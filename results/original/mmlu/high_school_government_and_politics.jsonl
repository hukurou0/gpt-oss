Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\nB. Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\nC. Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\nD. Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\n\nWhich is NOT true? Let's analyze. Executive orders: They are directives from the President that manage operations of federal government. They are not laws passed by Congress, but have the force of law. So statement B says \"have the same effect as laws passed by Congress\" - is that true? They have the same effect as law? They are subordinate to law, but they can have force of law. Some would say they can be considered law, but they can be overridden. But the statement is generally false: Executive orders do not have same effect as laws passed by Congress. So B is NOT true. Statement A: Presidents do use executive orders for controversial actions, not avoid. So A also false. The question: \"Which of the following is NOT true of executive orders?\" Actually two statements are false? Let's examine each:\n\nA. Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions. This is false; they use them for controversial actions often. So it's NOT true.\n\nB. Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress. That is also false; they are not the same. So also NOT true.\n\nC. Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s. That is true.\n\nD. Executive orders bypass congressional approval. That's true.\n\nThus there are two false statements. The question expects one answer; maybe the intended false one is A or B. But which is the more correct answer? In typical government textbooks, a key fact: executive orders have the force of law, but they are not the same as laws passed by Congress because they can be overturned by Congress. The statement \"have the same effect as laws passed by Congress\" is often considered false. But \"Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions\" is also false. But the typical textbook answer would be B. Let's examine: The question: \"Which of the following is NOT true of executive orders?\" We could interpret \"not true\" as the incorrect statement. There are two incorrect statements but they might consider one as \"NOT true.\" Many multiple choice sets have only one correct answer.

The last question: \"Incumbent members of the House of Representatives win reelection more often than incumbent senators for all of the following reasons EXCEPT\" Options A-D. They want a single character answer. So we choose the correct answer letter. We need to determine which one is NOT a reason. Let's analyze. The question: incumbents win reelection more often than senators for all of the following reasons EXCEPT. So which is not a reason why House incumbents have higher reelection rates relative to Senate incumbents. Let's analyze each:\n\nA. \"representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party\" - that would give advantage to incumbents in House because local constituents more often same party. That is indeed a reason? House incumbents have advantage due to local party alignment. Might be true. Senators have national-level contests where partisanship less strongly local, so advantage smaller. So A is a reason. So it's not the answer.\n\nB. \"senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively\" - This suggests that because senators have more power, their races are contested more aggressively. That would actually reduce incumbents advantage for Senate? That could be a reason why House incumbents win more often: Senate races contested more aggressively, making incumbents less likely to win? This could be a reason. So B is a reason, maybe. But is that a reason? Could be.\n\nC. \"representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents\" - House incumbents can use \"pork-barrel\" to send mail to constituents, giving advantage. So that's a reason. So C is a reason.\n\nD. \"representatives more often run uncontested\" - House incumbents often run uncontested. That also is a reason. So all four seem plausible. But question says EXCEPT. So maybe one of them is not a reason. Let's think deeper. Actually, the question states: \"Incumbent members of the House of Representatives win reelection more often than incumbent senators for all of the following reasons EXCEPT\". So we need the option that is NOT a reason. Let's analyze each option with nuance.\n\nOption A: \"representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party\". That could be true because House districts are smaller and more homogeneous. Senate districts are entire state, can be more diverse. So yes.\n\nOption B: \"senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively\". This may or may not be a reason. Senators have more power, but that would make Senate races more contested? But contested more aggressively may make incumbents less likely to win, but the statement says that is a reason why House incumbents win more often than Senate incumbents. Yes, that could be a reason. So B is plausible.\n\nOption C: \"representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents\". That is an advantage. True.\n\nOption D: \"representatives more often run uncontested\". That is indeed a reason. So all are reasons. But maybe one is false: For example, direct mail from federal funds is not necessarily a typical advantage. House members may use \"pork barrel\" but direct mail from federal funds might not be allowed or might be used by senators too. The more likely false is D: \"representatives more often run uncontested.\" Actually House incumbents sometimes face primary challengers but often run uncontested in general elections too, but senators often also run uncontested? Let's think: Senate races historically have higher contest rates. But the statement \"representatives more often run uncontested\" might be true. But maybe the question expects that D is the false reason. Actually, maybe \"representatives more often run uncontested\" might be false because Senate incumbents run uncontested too? Let's check. Historically, House incumbents face fewer challengers than Senate. According to data, 90% of House incumbents run unopposed in the general election? Not sure. Let's see typical numbers: In 2022, about 90% of House incumbents had no Democratic challenger? Might be. For Senate, less than 60% had no opponent? Might be. So House more likely to run uncontested. So D is true. So not answer.\n\nOption B: \"senators have more political power... contested more aggressively\" This might be arguable. But contested more aggressively does not necessarily reduce incumbents advantage? But maybe it does. The question says \"for all of the following reasons EXCEPT\". So one of these statements is not a reason why House incumbents win more often than Senate incumbents. Which one is not a reason? Let's think about each.\n\nOption A: \"representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party.\" This is basically that House districts are smaller, thus more homogeneous, giving advantage. Yes.\n\nOption B: \"senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively.\" This statement could be a reason because more contested reduces incumbents advantage. But is it accurate that Senate races contested more aggressively because of their higher power? Senators have more power but also face more national attention, more fundraising, etc. So maybe contested more aggressively leads to more defeats for incumbents? But Senate incumbents have high reelection rates too, but lower than House. But the reason might be contested more aggressively indeed. So it's plausible.\n\nOption C: \"representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents.\" This is a known advantage: House members have more opportunity to claim local benefits, can claim to deliver benefits to constituents, using the \"pork\" to get money. So it's a reason.\n\nOption D: \"representatives more often run uncontested.\" This is also a reason.\n\nSo all four seem plausible. But the question says \"EXCEPT\". So maybe one of these is not actually a reason. Which one is likely not a reason? Let's analyze the nuance: Senators have more political power, but Senate races are contested more aggressively. But does that actually lead to incumbents winning less often? If Senate races are more contested, then incumbents have less chance. But is that contested more aggressively due to higher power? Possibly. But maybe the factor that matters is that Senate races are contested more aggressively because they are higher stakes and because of nationalization, but that doesn't necessarily affect incumbents advantage? Actually it does. So it might be considered a reason.\n\nHowever, one of the options might be obviously false. Let's examine each for factual accuracy:\n\nOption A: \"representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party.\" This might not be the best reason; it's about the party affiliation of constituents. In House districts, there might be more partisan alignment, but not necessarily \"largely\" to representative's party. For example, House districts can be heavily partisan. But it's arguable.\n\nOption B: \"senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively.\" Actually, senators may have more power, but the contest level might not be because of power but because of national prominence, etc. However, it's plausible.\n\nOption C: \"representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents.\" House members can claim benefits like \"I brought you money for roads\" etc. But direct mail from federal funds? They might send mail funded by their own campaign money, not federal. But direct mail from federal funds? That might be false. Because they cannot use federal funds to advertise to constituents. They can use constituent services, but not federal funds. So this might be the false one. House members could use federal funds for \"public service announcements\"? Actually, House members can use federal funds for their staff to communicate to constituents about federal programs. But direct mail to constituents about achievements might be funded by their office but not federal. However, the statement might be ambiguous. But typical textbooks mention that House members use \"pork barrel\" to claim local benefits. They can send mail to constituents about the benefits they brought. That mail is typically funded by the representative's own office budget, which is federal. Wait, is the office budget federal? The congressional office budget is federal. Yes, each member has an office budget allocated by Congress. So they can use federal funds for their office, including mailings. So \"representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents.\" That is actually possible. So C might be true.\n\nOption D: \"representatives more often run uncontested.\" This is indeed true.\n\nSo which is not a reason? Let's consider typical explanations: House incumbents have advantage because of low campaign costs, less need for national advertising, ability to deliver local benefits, lower visibility, less contested. Senate incumbents face tougher contests due to high visibility and national campaigns. So the reasons would be: smaller district, ability to deliver local benefits, lower contest rates. So B might not be a reason because it's not about power but about contest aggressiveness. But B says senators have more power and thus are contested more aggressively. That could be a reason. But maybe the factor that senators have more power is not the main reason; it's because Senate races are contested more aggressively because of national campaigns. The power factor might be not a direct reason. But still, it's plausible. However, the question is from high school government & politics. They might have a multiple-choice question. Usually the \"EXCEPT\" is the one that doesn't fit the pattern. Which one is not a reason? Let's see typical answers: House incumbents win more often than Senate incumbents for following reasons: (1) House districts are smaller and more homogeneous, (2) House members have more opportunities to use \"pork barrel\" for local projects, (3) House members are less likely to run contested races. So B about senators having more power and contested more aggressively is less typical. So B might be the \"EXCEPT\" answer. Because that explanation is not a reason. The question says \"incumbent members of the House of Representatives win reelection more often than incumbent senators for all of the following reasons EXCEPT\" So B might be the one that is not a reason. However, we need to choose a letter: A, B, C, or D. Which one? Let's analyze again:\n\nOption A: Constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party. That's a reason because House districts are small.\n\nOption B: Senators have more political power... contested more aggressively. That may be a reason? Let's examine more: If senators have more power, their races are contested more aggressively. That could reduce their reelection rates. So it's a reason.\n\nOption C: Representatives may use federal funds to publicize achievements via direct mail. That's a reason.\n\nOption D: Representatives more often run uncontested. That's a reason.\n\nSo all are reasons? But the question says EXCEPT. So maybe one of these is not true. Let's evaluate the truth of each:\n\nA: Constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party. That might be partially true but not necessarily \"largely.\" For example, many districts are competitive. But House incumbents can still win because of incumbency, not because of constituent party alignment. But still, House districts can be more partisan. So maybe it's a reason.\n\nB: Senators have more political power, so Senate races are contested more aggressively. Senators have more power, but Senate races contested more aggressively might not be because of the power but because of national media coverage. So not necessarily a reason.\n\nC: Representatives may use federal funds to publicize achievements via direct mail to constituents. House members can use the office budget to send mail. That's true. But direct mail to constituents is part of their constituent services. So yes.\n\nD: Representatives more often run uncontested. House incumbents often run uncontested in general elections. That's true.\n\nThus, the one that might be inaccurate is B. So answer is B. But the question is to answer with a single character.

In US elections, candidates focus on battleground / swing states (or competitive states) because they determine electoral votes. So they don't avoid battlegrounds; they focus on them. Option D says campaign extensively in states that heavily favor one party over the other - that's not right because they'd focus on swing states. Option A says avoid battleground states and focus on safe states - wrong. Option B says campaign more heavily in states with large populations - but those may be safe or not. Candidates focus on swing states, which may not necessarily have largest populations (like Ohio, Florida). Option C is about Plains states - not correct.\n\nThus correct answer: none of the given? Wait maybe the intended correct answer: they campaign more heavily in states with large populations? Actually historically, candidates focus on swing states with large numbers of electoral votes. So maybe they \"campaign more heavily in states with large populations\" because those often include swing states? But the phrase \"given the structure of the electoral college\" - the system rewards large populations with electoral votes, but safe states also have large populations but are safe. Candidates focus on battleground states. So correct answer would be B? Let's think.\n\nWhich statement best captures the strategy? Candidates focus on swing states, regardless of population. So none of the options mention swing states. Option A says avoid battleground states: wrong. Option B says campaign more heavily in states with large populations: that might be true but not the main reason; they also focus on battleground states. But maybe they do focus on large-population battleground states. Option C is about Plains States: no. Option D: campaign extensively in states that heavily favor one party over the other: that's also wrong.\n\nThus none of the options seem correct. But we must choose one. The best is B? Wait the structure of the electoral college: each state gets electoral votes equal to its representation in Congress (Senate+House). So states with large populations have more electoral votes. Candidates thus campaign more heavily in states with large populations. But they also avoid safe states. So they'd focus on large-population swing states. So B could be considered correct.

The answer is not provided. We need to answer the last question with a single character. The instructions: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we must determine the correct answer letter. Let's analyze the question: \"Failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level\" The options:\n\nA. on appeal by state prosecutors\nB. under the \"double jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution\nC. because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict\nD. as civil liberties violations\n\nWe need the correct option. The situation: If a felony prosecution fails at the state level (e.g., due to procedural issues, or evidence insufficient), can it be retried at the federal level? Usually, if a case fails due to double jeopardy, cannot retry. However, double jeopardy prevents a second trial after acquittal or conviction. But if the state fails to convict because of insufficient evidence or procedural defect, can federal authorities prosecute if the crime violates federal law? Yes, the federal government can prosecute for the same act if there's a federal violation. But this is not due to double jeopardy because there is no state conviction. The question states \"Failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level\". The correct answer likely is \"because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Option C says \"because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict\". That implies a state-level verdict was voided by new evidence. But the question is about failed prosecutions, not convictions. Option A: \"on appeal by state prosecutors\" - no. Option B: \"under the \"double jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution\" - no; double jeopardy prohibits retrial after acquittal or conviction; but if no state conviction, no double jeopardy. Option D: \"as civil liberties violations\" - no. So what's correct? Let's think: There is a concept of \"federal prosecution of crimes that also violate state law\" - known as \"dual sovereignty\". Even if state prosecution failed, the federal government can still prosecute for the same act because state and federal are separate sovereigns. The question might be referencing that concept. But none of the options mention \"dual sovereignty\". Option C: \"because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict\" - but if verdict voided, it's not a failed prosecution; it's a reversal. Option B: \"under double jeopardy\" - no. Option A: \"on appeal by state prosecutors\" - no. Option D: \"as civil liberties violations\" - no. Wait maybe the question expects answer A? Let's read: \"Failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level\" The phrase \"Failed felony prosecutions\" might mean \"failed to convict\" maybe due to insufficient evidence. The federal government can bring charges based on the same acts, especially if there is a federal element (e.g., kidnapping, interstate commerce, etc.). That is allowed. This is called \"dual sovereignty\" doctrine, but the options don't mention. But maybe the best answer is \"B\" because double jeopardy does not apply because state and federal are separate sovereigns. So the correct answer might be B: \"under the 'double jeopardy' provision of the Constitution\". Wait the double jeopardy clause actually prohibits a second trial after acquittal or conviction by the same sovereign. But it allows a second trial by a different sovereign. So the answer could be \"B\" but with a nuance: It is permitted because double jeopardy does not apply to a second sovereign. But the answer is still B? Actually the phrase \"under the 'double jeopardy' provision\" indicates that it is allowed due to double jeopardy. But the correct statement: It's allowed because double jeopardy does not apply to a second sovereign. So B might be the answer. But the question: \"Failed felony prosecutions at the state level are sometimes retried at the federal level\" The correct answer: B. Let's choose B.

A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress. C. Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so. D. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president.\" We must pick the false statement. Let's analyze each.\n\nA. Only Congress can pass laws. In US, Congress passes laws, but also the President can sign into law. However the statement \"Only Congress can pass laws\" is ambiguous: only Congress has power to pass laws? The Constitution says only Congress may legislate; President can only sign. So that might be true. But is there any other body? No. So A is true.\n\nB. A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress. The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses (not delegates). So this is basically correct. The phrase \"delegates\" might be wrong but not the main issue. But it's essentially true: two-thirds of both houses. So B is true.\n\nC. Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so. Actually, override requires two-thirds of both the House and Senate (not two-thirds of the House and Senate as a single body). But the phrase \"two-thirds of the House and Senate agree\" means the same. So C is true.\n\nD. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president. The president has significant power over the bureaucracy. Congress also has oversight but the president likely has more direct control. So statement is true? It says \"Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president.\" That seems true. So all four appear true, but one is false. Let's scrutinize.\n\nPerhaps the false statement is C, because override requires two-thirds in both houses, not two-thirds of each house? Wait that is the same. But maybe the statement incorrectly says \"two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so.\" That is indeed two-thirds of each. So it's correct. Hmm.\n\nMaybe A is false because the President also can pass laws via executive orders? Not exactly laws, but can issue executive orders. But the phrase \"Only Congress can pass laws\" is a statement of authority. The Constitution says \"All legislative powers are vested in Congress.\" So A is true.\n\nB: The amendment process requires a two-thirds of both houses of Congress or a national convention. But the text: \"a proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress.\" Actually, the amendment process requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress, not delegates. But \"delegates\" could refer to members of Congress. So it's basically correct.\n\nD: Congressional power over bureaucracy less than president. The President appoints heads of executive agencies (with Senate confirmation). But Congress also has power to create agencies, allocate funds. So the statement that Congress has less power is maybe arguable but I think true.\n\nHowever maybe the false is B because of \"delegates\" vs \"members\"? But that may be semantics. But maybe it's false because a two-thirds of each house is required, but the phrase \"two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress\" might incorrectly refer to \"delegates\" which may be all delegates from each state? Actually, in the Constitutional convention, \"delegates\" refers to delegates from each state. But for amendment, it's the two houses of Congress, each has members not delegates. So maybe the phrase \"delegates\" is wrong. But still the essence is right.\n\nLet's think: The question is about Congress. Which statement is false? Let's analyze each deeper:\n\nA. Only Congress can pass laws. The President can veto but cannot pass laws. The Supreme Court interprets. So yes, only Congress legislates. So correct.\n\nB. Amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress. Actually, the Constitution states \"two-thirds of the members of both Houses\" not delegates. So maybe \"delegates\" refers to \"members of each house\" so it's same. So likely correct.\n\nC. Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so. This is correct.\n\nD. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president. This might be a matter of debate: Congress has significant control via appropriations and oversight. President has more direct control over the executive branch but Congress also has some influence. The statement might be contested but likely true.\n\nMaybe the false one is B because \"two-thirds of the delegates in both houses\" is wrong because \"delegates\" refers to members of a convention. The amendment process requires two-thirds in both houses of Congress; not delegates. So the statement incorrectly says \"delegates\". So it's false. So answer should be B.\n\nBut the question says \"All of the following statements about Congress are true EXCEPT:\" So we choose false one: B.

That might be the correct title? Actually the head of DHS is the Secretary of Homeland Security. The question uses \"Director\" incorrectly. But likely they mean the head of DHS. That is a Cabinet-level position, so requires Senate confirmation. National Security Advisor is not a Cabinet-level position? The National Security Advisor is a position within the White House, but not a Cabinet-level? The National Security Advisor is not a constitutional office; it's appointed by the President and does not require Senate confirmation.

It's a non-enforcement, but courts still have authority; but this question is about limiting influence. A governor refusing to enforce is a form of noncompliance, but may limit the influence of courts over that jurisdiction. So it can limit influence.\n\nD.

Wait, we need to determine correct answer: \"Among the executive branch's checks on the legislative branch is the president's power to: A. call special sessions of Congress B. introduce bills to the floor of Congress C. address Congress during its debate on bills D. vote on acts of Congress\".\n\nThe correct check: President can veto legislation. But not in options. Also can call special sessions of Congress? Actually the Constitution gives Congress the power to convene Congress, not the President. The President can address Congress. But is that a check? The President can address Congress, but that is not a direct check. The President can also veto. So none of the options match. Wait, \"call special sessions of Congress\" is a power of Congress, not President. President can convene the National Guard? But not sessions. So perhaps the best is \"address Congress during its debate on bills\" as a way to influence. But the question says \"Among the executive branch's checks on the legislative branch is the president's power to\". The power to veto is a check. But not listed. Could be \"address Congress during its debate\" is a check because the president can address Congress and influence. However that is not a formal check. The correct answer likely is A? Wait, maybe the question is from some test: \"Among the executive branch's checks on the legislative branch is the president's power to: A. call special sessions of Congress\" Actually that might be a power of the president: The president can call a special session of Congress? The President can convene Congress in emergency? According to Article I, Section 3: \"The President shall be the Commander in Chief...\". Hmm. The President does not have that power. The President has the power to veto bills and can call Congress to a special session? Article I, Section 3 says \"The Congress may by law provide for calling a special session of Congress.\" So not President. So option A is wrong.\n\nOption B: \"introduce bills to the floor of Congress\" That is not a power of the president. The president can propose legislation to Congress but not introduce on the floor. Option C: \"address Congress during its debate on bills\" The president can address Congress and influence debate.
