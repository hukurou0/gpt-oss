Let's think: Normalization of deviance: when deviant behavior becomes normalized, it's seen as normal, i.e., \"attributed to person's genetic or anatomical makeup\"? No. Recognised as breaking norm? No, because it's normalized. So likely B: seen as a temporary aberration? Actually normalized means it is seen as normal? Wait. The definition: \"normalized deviance\" meaning that deviant behavior becomes accepted or normalized. So it's not seen as breaking a norm; it's seen as normal. So maybe D? But D says attributed to genetic makeup, which seems wrong. B says seen as a temporary aberration from normal. That's not normalization. That would be the opposite: it is still seen as abnormal. Normalized would be seen as normal. None of the options directly says \"seen as normal\". Let's read carefully: B: seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character. That's not normalized. So answer might be A? Recognised as breaking an important norm. That is not normalized. Hmm. Maybe the question intends the concept of \"normalized deviance\" meaning the act is seen as normal? None of the options. Maybe the correct answer is B? But that would be a mismatch.

But B says seen as temporary aberration. That is still not normalized. Hmm. But maybe they think that if deviance is normalized, it's no longer seen as deviant: it's seen as normal. But none of options reflect that. Maybe the correct answer is \"B\" because it's considered a temporary aberration from normal? Actually if normalized, it's not an aberration. So wrong. Let's reconsider: Maybe the question uses the concept of \"normalized deviance\" meaning that deviant act is seen as normal over time; that would correspond to \"A\" recognized as breaking an important norm? No. Recognized as breaking important norm means it's still deviant. So not.\n\nIt seems none match.

The debate: some argue that managers gained control of firms. Scott might have argued that the managerial class was not autonomous but still tied to owners via shareholder structures.

Let's confirm: Sutherland's professional thief study found that thieves were from middle class and had a professional identity.

Actually the concept: a garden city is a self-contained community surrounded by greenbelts, containing carefully balanced areas for residences, industry, agriculture. He proposed multiple garden cities? He had \"garden city\" as a model, and he wanted a network of garden cities each connected to central city. The options: A says \"six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city\". That could be his idea of a network of garden cities, each being a small town with green belts, linked to larger city? He did propose a system of \"garden cities\" around central city?

She argued that girls are attached to mother, then break away; boys are attached to father, and then girls break away? Wait: Let's recall.\n\nIn \"The Reproduction of Mothering\" (1978), Chodorow argued that gender identity is formed through psychoanalytic processes of identification with the mother. She argued that the mother is the central figure for both sexes, but boys eventually break away from the mother to identify with the father; girls maintain attachment to mother but may also identify with father? Wait, need to check.\n\nChodorow's theory: She says that boys are primarily attached to their mothers in the same way as girls, but boys eventually break away from the mother and identify with the father, thus creating a masculine identity. Girls, however, continue their attachment to mother but may also identify with father later.\n\nBut the question: \"Chodorow (1978) argued that gender socialization occurred through:\" Option A: both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away. Option B: girls being attached to their mothers but then breaking away. Option C: boys being attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers. Option D: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but girls breaking away.\n\nThe correct answer appears to be Option A.\n\nBut let's verify: Many references to Chodorow's theory: She says that both genders initially see the mother as the primary caregiver, but boys break away from the mother to identify with the father; girls, however, maintain the maternal bond and incorporate the father as an object of desire? Wait, but the question specifically: \"Chodorow (1978) argued that gender socialization occurred through:\" Option A: both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away. Option B: girls being attached to their mothers but then breaking away. Option C: boys being attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers. Option D: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but girls breaking away.\n\nChodorow's theory indeed states that boys break away from mother to identify with father, while girls maintain attachment to mother.

In sociology, sect typically has strict belief system, small group, often charismatic leadership, closed membership, high emotional commitment, high internal cohesion. Let's recall typical features: Sects are usually smaller, have a strict code, and a charismatic leader, highly disciplined. They are often opposed to mainstream religion, they often have high emotional commitment. Option C: voluntary membership, democratic leadership, high levels of emotional commitment. But sects are usually not democratic; they usually have a charismatic leader. Option A: beliefs that can be challenged by members, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits. Sects generally have rigid beliefs, not challengeable. Option D: the idea of secular world itself as sacred? That's a concept of secularism not sect.\n\nOption B: tolerance towards other religions and separation of church and state? That sounds like secular society, not sect.\n\nThus the best answer may be C? But sects have high emotional commitment but not necessarily democratic leadership; they often have a charismatic leader. But the question might be from a sociology exam, typical definition: A sect is a religious group with a distinct set of beliefs, high level of commitment, smaller membership, often with charismatic leaders. Option C mentions voluntary membership, democratic leadership, emotional commitment. But the emphasis on democratic leadership may be wrong; sects might have non-democratic leadership. But perhaps the test's answer is C because it's the one that says high emotional commitment, which is key. But does voluntary membership apply?

Actually \"right order (from highest to lowest status)\" means first item highest status.\n\nWe need to recall British hierarchy: Highest: Monarch, then King/Queen's family. Then dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons. Then higher nobility: e.g., archbishops? The Archbishop of York is second highest ecclesiastical office, below Pope, but in UK? The Archbishop of Canterbury is top, then Archbishop of York. Also the Prime Minister? Usually the Prime Minister is high but maybe lower than the Archbishop? Actually precedence: The monarch is first, then the Archbishop of Canterbury, then the monarch's family, then other high positions, then the Duke etc. The Prime Minister is a civil position, may rank after the monarch but before the archbishop? I'm not sure.\n\nOption A: Prime Minister, Archbishop of York, Viscounts of England. Order: PM highest, then Archbishop, then viscounts. Is that correct? Precedence: The Archbishop of Canterbury is first ecclesiastical. The Archbishop of York second. The PM is high but maybe lower than Archbishop? I think the Archbishop of Canterbury has precedence over the PM? Let's check: In UK precedence: The monarch, then the Archbishop of Canterbury, then the Archbishop of York, then the monarch's family, then the Duke of Cambridge? But the PM is also high but I think the Archbishop has precedence. However the PM is a civil office that might outrank the Archbishop? I'm not fully sure.\n\nOption B: Marquesses of England, Earls of Great Britain, King's Brothers. Wait \"King's Brothers\" are siblings of the monarch, I think they have high precedence. But the order: Marquesses highest among nobles, then Earls, then King's Brothers? That seems odd because the King's Brothers outrank all peers. So correct order would be King's Brothers, Marquesses, Earls. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons. Order: Esquires are lower than Serjeants? Actually Serjeants of Law are senior lawyers, historically high. The eldest sons of Dukes are maybe not recognized until they inherit title? But still maybe high. The order as given: Esquires first (lowest), then Serjeants, then Dukes' Eldest Sons (highest). That could be correct? But I'm not sure about precedence of esquires relative to serjeants. Actually Esquires are gentry, but Serjeants of Law are a group of senior barristers (Serjeants). Historically they were a rank above barristers, but not necessarily high social status. But maybe in precedence, they are considered lower than Esquires? Let's see: In the order of precedence, the order after the peers goes to the Royal Household, then the Knights, then the Gentry? Wait: Precedence: The Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron; then the Knight, then Esquire; then Serjeants? I'm not sure.\n\nOption D: King's Grandsons, Lord High Treasurer, Companions of the Bath. The Lord High Treasurer is a high office, but the King's Grandsons are of high rank. But the Companions of the Bath are a chivalric order; I'm not sure. So D maybe wrong.\n\nThus likely correct answer is A? But we need to check precedence: In UK, precedence order: 1. Monarch; 2. The monarch's family; 3. The Archbishop of Canterbury; 4. The Archbishop of York; 5. The Lord High Steward, the Lord High Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council; 6. The Prime Minister; 7. The Earl Marshal; 8. The Lord Great Chamberlain; 9. The Lord High Treasurer; 10. The Duke of... etc. So PM outranks archbishop? Wait the Archbishop of Canterbury is before the PM. But in order given, PM highest, archbishop second; but actual order has archbishop above PM. So A is not correct.\n\nLet's check B again: Marquesses, Earls, King's Brothers. King's Brothers outrank all. So B wrong.\n\nOption C: Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons. Are Dukes' eldest sons considered a \"Duke's eldest son\" but not yet a duke? They are heir apparent. In precedence, the heir to a peer's title is considered at same rank as peers? The eldest son of a duke (the Marquess) might be called a Marquess as courtesy title. But the eldest son of a duke may hold a courtesy title like Marquess or Earl. So his precedence might be as a Marquess. But they are not listed as a rank in the question. The question likely expects that the eldest sons of Dukes are considered as the same rank as Dukes? Not sure.\n\nSerjeants of Law: They are a specific order of senior barristers. But do they outrank Esquires? Historically Serjeants were senior to barristers and knights? I'm not sure.\n\nOption D: King's Grandsons (lowest?), Lord High Treasurer (high office), Companions of the Bath (knight). But Lord High Treasurer is a high office, but not necessarily above King's grandsons. And Companions of the Bath may be lower. So D seems wrong.\n\nThus maybe C is correct. Let's research: In order of precedence of the nobility: Dukes > Marquesses > Earls > Viscounts > Barons > Knights > Esquires. So Esquires are below knights, but above Serjeants? Actually Serjeants of Law historically had high standing in the legal profession but not necessarily above the gentry. But in precedence, I think they might be below Esquires. But the question is about upper class? The term \"upper class\" maybe refers to the aristocracy: Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons. But Esquires, Serjeants, etc. may be lower.\n\nOption C: Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons. Highest: Dukes' eldest sons. Middle: Serjeants. Lowest: Esquires. That seems plausible: Esquires are lower than Serjeants of Law? Actually I'm not sure. But let's think: Serjeants of Law are a very senior group of lawyers; they are not gentry but professionals; historically they were the only ones allowed to plead at the royal courts. So they might rank above esquires? Possibly. So the order given: Esquires lowest, Serjeants middle, Dukes' eldest sons highest. That seems plausible.\n\nThus the answer might be C.\n\nBut we must output a single character: 'C'.\n\nBut we need to be sure.\n\nDouble-check: The question: \"In the traditional hierarchy of status and precedence, which of these members of the upper class are in the right order (from highest to lowest status)?\" So we need to pick the correct ordering.\n\nOption A: PM, Archbishop of York, Viscounts. We think PM is lower than Archbishop of York. So A wrong.\n\nOption B: Marquesses, Earls, King's Brothers. King's Brothers outrank all. So wrong.\n\nOption C: Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons. If esquires lowest, serjeants middle, eldest sons highest. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D: King's Grandsons, Lord High Treasurer, Companions of the Bath. Lord High Treasurer is high office, but King's Grandsons outrank him? Actually King's grandchildren may outrank the Lord High Treasurer, yes. So the order given: King's Grandsons, Lord High Treasurer, Companions of the Bath. That would be high, medium, low. That could also be plausible? Wait \"Companions of the Bath\" is a chivalric order. They are knights. But the Lord High Treasurer is a high office. King's Grandsons are high. So order is high, medium, low. That seems plausible. But is the Lord High Treasurer's precedence above the Companion of the Bath? Yes, likely. So option D might also be correct. Let's examine: The Lord High Treasurer is a great office; historically the Lord High Treasurer was part of the Great Officers of State. So it's high. Companions of the Bath are knights, lower. So D seems plausible too.\n\nBut question says \"members of the upper class\". King's Grandsons: yes, royal family. Lord High Treasurer: a position, not necessarily a class, but a high office. Companion of the Bath: a knight, lower. So D might be correct.\n\nLet's think: The question might be about the order of precedence: The Lord High Treasurer would outrank a Companion of the Bath? Yes. So order King's Grandsons > Lord High Treasurer > Companion of the Bath seems right. But is King's Grandsons actually higher than the Lord High Treasurer? Yes, probably. So D is correct.\n\nBut we must decide which option is best. We need to choose one. Let's research quickly: In the UK, order of precedence: after the monarch, the heir apparent, then the monarch's consort, then the king/queen's siblings, then the royal family. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, then the Archbishop of York, then the Lord High Steward, then the Lord High Chancellor, then the Lord President of the Council, then the Lord Privy Seal, then the Lord High Treasurer, etc. Then the Earl Marshal, then the Lord Great Chamberlain, then the Great Officers of State, then the Prime Minister, then the Lord High Admiral, etc.\n\nBut the Lord High Treasurer is a Great Officer of State. That office historically existed but is now abolished? But anyway.\n\nHowever, in the list, the King's Grandsons are highest. Then the Lord High Treasurer. Then Companions of the Bath. That matches D. Option D seems correct.\n\nCheck option C: Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons. But is Esquire lower than Serjeants? Actually Esquires are members of the gentry; Serjeants of Law are senior lawyers, but historically not considered high in social rank. However, maybe they outrank esquires. But the question is about upper class; serjeants might not be considered upper class? The eldest sons of dukes are definitely upper class. So D seems more plausible.\n\nThus answer likely D.\n\nBut check the wording: \"members of the upper class\" suggests they are all upper class. Esquires may be part of gentry, but not necessarily upper class? But they might be considered upper. However, the question expects one correct ordering. Option D seems to include King's Grandsons (upper), Lord High Treasurer (upper), Companions of the Bath (upper). Option D seems plausible.\n\nThus choose D.\n\nAnswer: D.", "predicted_answer": "D", "correct_answer": "D", "is_correct": true, "ai_time_seconds": 14.22}

She argues that the rise of anorexia and bulimia is linked to cultural values of thinness, self-discipline, and control, especially among women. She discusses how Western societies emphasize self-discipline, personal responsibility, and the pursuit of control. She also addresses the link between the cultural ideal of \"thinness\" and the notion of self-discipline. She suggests that anorexia is an expression of socialized self-control. She also suggests that the \"new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity\" combined with cultural values of achievement and control has contributed to the epidemic.

We need to recall that Booth's 1901 study (Charles Booth's \"Life and Labour of the People in London\") indicated poverty levels. I think the percentage of poor in London was around 30%. Actually, Booth's study had categories: \"Poor, near poor, comfortable\". The data: In 1901, about 30% of Londoners were living in poverty. But more precisely, Booth classified into \"Poor\", \"Near Poor\" etc. The total poor was about 30%. I recall that around 30% were poor.

Let's recall that Frank 1967 is likely referring to Karl Frank? Wait: \"Frank (1967)\" could be \"Frank, Karl\" or \"Frank, James\" maybe. But in sociology, \"Frank, R. A. 1967\"? Actually, maybe \"Frank, R. A.\" refers to \"Frank, R. A. (1967).

Alternatively, \"Underdeveloped\" refers to \"underdevelopment theory\" which states that underdeveloped societies are dependent on the core (wealthy countries) and that underdevelopment results from a history of exploitation. So answer C might be correct.\n\nBut let's recall: The \"development\" theory by Frank (1967) says \"underdevelopment is the condition that arises from the relationship with core countries. It's a dependent economy.\" So that would be option C.\n\nOption A says \"insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy\" - but that is not accurate. Underdeveloped societies are indeed insufficiently involved, but that may be a result of exploitation. Option B \"reluctant to surrender their traditional ways of life\" is not Frank's claim.

The question: \"The introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1980s resulted in:\"\n\nOptions: \nA. more funding for students in higher education\nB. the delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs\nC. a reduction in parental choice of school\nD. increased state regulation through national testing and inspections\n\nIn the UK, introduction of market principles in education in 1980s (under Thatcher) resulted in: school choice, competition, school funding based on student numbers (per pupil funding), delegation of power to local authorities (LEAs) to decide budgets; increased state regulation? Actually Thatcher introduced market mechanisms: funding formula per pupil, competition among schools, school-based funding; LEAs had more control? Let's recall: Under the Education Reform Act 1988, there was the introduction of school management units (SMUs) and the shift to a per pupil funding formula, giving schools more autonomy. But the question might refer to \"delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs\" as B. Option A about more funding for students in higher education seems not right. Option C: reduction in parental choice of school? That seems wrong: parents got more choice. Option D: increased state regulation through national testing and inspections? Actually, state regulation increased; but also there was an emphasis on national curriculum, but it's not necessarily more regulation through testing? Possibly B is correct. The question: \"The introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1980s resulted in: B.\" But we need to verify.\n\nLet's analyze: Market principles: competition, private sector involvement, choice, accountability. In UK 1980s, the 1988 Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum, national tests (SATs), school inspections, and a per-pupil funding formula. It also created local authority funding responsibilities, but also increased competition among schools, more autonomy for schools. The question likely from sociology of education. The correct answer likely: B. Let's commit to B.\n\nThus we output \"B\".\n\nBut we need to be sure: Option B: \"the delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs.\" Wait, LEA is Local Education Authority. In the 1980s, the central government decreased control over school budgets? Actually the central government gave more control to local authorities? Let's recall: Under the 1988 Act, funding responsibility transferred to the LEAs, but local authority funding was also decreased? Actually the 1988 Act introduced the concept of \"School Management Units\" within LEAs. The funding formula was introduced. The LEAs had to decide on budgets for schools. So yes, delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs. So B.\n\nThus answer: B.", "predicted_answer": "B", "correct_answer": "D", "is_correct": false, "ai_time_seconds": 3.18}

The last question: \"Which of the following did DomÂ hoff not identify as a process of decision-making in the USA? A. the ideology process B. the exploitation process C. the policy-formation process D. the candidate-selection process Answer:\". We need to provide a single character as per developer instruction. We must figure out the correct answer: which process Domhoff did not identify. The known processes according to Robert Domhoff's \"Power Elite\" and \"The Undead: The Dominant Elite\". He identified 4 processes: ideology, exploitation, policy-formation, candidate selection? Letâs recall. Domhoff's process: He identifies 4 decision-making processes: ideology, exploitation, policy-formation, and candidate-selection. Actually he does identify all those? Wait check. In Domhoff's \"Power Elite\", he defines four decision-making processes: ideology, exploitation, policy formation, and candidate selection. So all four are indeed identified. So maybe the question expects which one is not included? But all four are included. But maybe he did not identify \"exploitation\" as a decision-making process, but rather \"exploitation\" as a component of elite? Let's recall: In \"Power Elite\", he identifies \"ideology\", \"exploitation\", \"policy-formation\", and \"candidate selection\" as processes used by elite to maintain power. So all four. But the question might be trick: which did Domhoff not identify? Could be \"the exploitation process\" not being part of his model. But that seems wrong. Let's confirm by referencing: Robert J. Domhoff's book \"The Undead: The Dominant Elite and the Persistence of Power in America\" identifies four \"processes\": ideology, exploitation, policy-formation, and candidate-selection. So all four. So maybe the answer is none; but the question expects one answer. Which one is not? If all four are indeed identified, maybe the correct answer would be \"none of the above\" but not offered. So maybe the answer is \"A\" incorrectly? Let's search memory: Actually Domhoff identifies three processes: ideology, exploitation, and policy-formation. Candidate-selection might be not part? He might mention candidate-selection as a process of elite selecting leaders. But not sure. Let's quickly recall: In \"The Undead\", Domhoff lists \"The 4 Processes of Elite Power\": 1) Ideological: shaping ideas, 2) Economic: controlling resources (exploitation), 3) Political: policy-formation, and 4) Social: candidate-selection? I'm uncertain.\n\nMaybe the answer is \"B\" the exploitation process? Let's examine: In Domhoff's \"Power Elite\", he mentions that the elite maintain power through 3 main mechanisms: 1) Ideology, 2) Control of the economy (exploitation), and 3) Policy-making. He does not mention candidate selection explicitly. But in \"The Undead\" he might mention candidate selection. Letâs quickly recall: Domhoff wrote about the elite's influence on political parties and candidate selection as part of their process. So candidate-selection is indeed part of his model.\n\nThus the one not identified might be \"B\" exploitation, but that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe Domhoff identified 4 processes: ideology, policy, exploitation, and candidate-selection. So all four. The question could be flawed.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is \"A\" ideology process? But that's definitely part. So hmm.\n\nLet's check: The question: \"Which of the following did Domhoff not identify as a process of decision-making in the USA?\" Possibly the correct answer is \"D. the candidate-selection process\" because Domhoff didn't mention candidate selection as a process; he mentions candidate selection but as part of the political elite, maybe not a process. But I'm not certain.\n\nLet's quickly search memory: In Domhoff's \"The Undead\", he describes \"the process of elite decision-making\" as a system of 3 main processes: ideology, exploitation, and policy formation. He also discusses how elite members are selected through \"circular career paths\" but that's not a process. Candidate selection may be considered part of the elite's influence, but not necessarily a \"process of decision-making.\" So maybe candidate-selection is not identified as a process. So answer D. Let's go with that.\n\nHence we need a single character answer: D.", "predicted_answer": "D", "correct_answer": "B", "is_correct": false, "ai_time_seconds": 4.52}
