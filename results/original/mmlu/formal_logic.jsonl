Counterexample when H and I are true and J is false D. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false. We need to pick the correct answer. Let's analyze argument: Premises: 1) H ≡ (~I ∨ J). 2) H ∨ ~J. Conclusion: ~I. We need to determine if premises entail conclusion. Let's try to check validity. Using logic equivalence: H ≡ (~I ∨ J) means H iff (~I ∨ J). That is H is true exactly when (~I ∨ J) is true. So H is equivalent to (~I ∨ J). The premise 2 says H ∨ ~J. We need to see if from these we can derive ~I.\n\nLet's consider truth assignments. We can attempt to see if there is a counterexample: premises true, conclusion false. Conclusion false means I is true. So we need I=true. Let's assign I=true. Then ~I is false, J can be true or false. Evaluate H. Since H ≡ (~I ∨ J) = (~true ∨ J) = (false ∨ J) = J. So H is equivalent to J. So H is true iff J is true.\n\nNow premises: 1) H ≡ (~I ∨ J). That is true by definition of equivalence? Actually we are using it as premise; we need the truth of that equivalence. For a given truth assignment, H ≡ (~I ∨ J) is true if H has same truth value as (~I ∨ J). So with I=true, H equivalent to J; So H is true iff J true. So the equivalence is true when H equals J. If J true, H true, equivalence true. If J false, H false, equivalence true. So equivalence is always true regardless of J? Wait if J false, then H false (since H=J). Then equivalence: false ≡ false = true. So yes equivalence holds. So premise 1 is satisfied automatically for any H=J assignment. But we also need H and J consistent with that. So premise 1 is satisfied for all assignments where H equals J. So we need also premise 2: H ∨ ~J must be true. Let's consider both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: J=true => H=true. Then H ∨ ~J = true ∨ false = true. So premise 2 true.\n\nCase 2: J=false => H=false. Then H ∨ ~J = false ∨ true = true. So premise 2 true.\n\nThus for I=true, any J, with H=J, both premises true. Conclusion ~I false (since I=true). So we have counterexample: I=true, J arbitrary, H=J. That satisfies premises but not conclusion. So argument invalid.\n\nNow we need to choose an option that presents a counterexample: Option B: \"Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false\" That would set I false, H false, J false. Let's test: I=false => ~I true. Conclusion ~I true. So not counterexample. Option C: \"Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and J is false\". Let's test: H=true, I=true, J=false. Then evaluate premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J) = (~true ∨ false) = false ∨ false = false. So H ≡ false? But H is true, so equivalence false. So premise1 false; not a counterexample. Option D: \"Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false.\" Test: I=true, H=false, J=false. Evaluate premise1: (~I ∨ J) = (~true ∨ false)= false ∨ false = false. H is false. So equivalence true (false ≡ false). Premise1 true. Premise2: H ∨ ~J = false ∨ true = true. So premises true. Conclusion ~I false. So indeed counterexample. So Option D is correct. But Option D says \"I is true and H and J are false.\" That matches our found counterexample.

Consistent. Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false\nAnswer:\"\n\nWe need to provide the answer for that last question. The previous answers are given for prior questions. The last one hasn't an answer yet. Let's analyze the consistency of the set of propositions.\n\nSet of formulas:\n1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)\n2. C ⊃ D\n3. A ∨ (B · ~D)\n4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)\n\nWe need to check if there is a valuation satisfying all four. Then choose the consistent valuation among options B, C, D, or say inconsistent.\n\nLet's analyze systematically.\n\nWe'll denote truth values: T or F.\n\nWe need to satisfy all four statements simultaneously.\n\nLet's derive conditions.\n\nFirst, A ≡ (B ⊃ D). This says A has same truth as (B ⊃ D). B ⊃ D is equivalent to (~B ∨ D).\n\nSo A ↔ (~B ∨ D). So A is true if (~B ∨ D) is true, false if (~B ∨ D) false (i.e., B true and D false). So we can treat A as (~B ∨ D). So we can substitute A = (~B ∨ D).\n\nNow the other statements:\n\n1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) is: If A then (~B ∨ C). But since A = (~B ∨ D), that becomes:\n\n(~B ∨ D) ⊃ (~B ∨ C).\n\nRecall that X ⊃ Y is equivalent to (~X ∨ Y). So:\n\n(~ (~B ∨ D) ∨ (~B ∨ C)). Simplify: ~(~B ∨ D) is B ∧ ~D. So we have:\n\n(B ∧ ~D) ∨ (~B ∨ C). This is true unless both components are false: i.e., unless (B ∧ ~D) is false AND (~B ∨ C) is false.\n\n- (~B ∨ C) is false iff ~B is false and C is false. That is B true and C false.\n- (B ∧ ~D) is false unless B true and D false? Wait, B ∧ ~D is true when B true and D false. So it's false when either B false or D true.\n\nThus the disjunction (B ∧ ~D) ∨ (~B ∨ C) is false if:\n\n- B ∧ ~D is false (i.e., B false OR D true)\n- and (~B ∨ C) is false (i.e., B true AND C false)\n\nFor the disjunction to be false, both must be false. That requires B false (from first) AND B true (from second). Contradiction. So the disjunction is always true regardless of values. Wait, check carefully:\n\nLet's analyze all possible assignments. But we can see that the disjunction includes (~B ∨ C). If C true, (~B ∨ C) true, disjunction true. If C false, then (~B ∨ C) reduces to ~B. So then expression becomes (B ∧ ~D) ∨ ~B. That's equivalent to (~B) ∨ (B ∧ ~D). That is true unless ~B false and B ∧ ~D false. ~B false means B true. B ∧ ~D false when either B false or ~D false. But B true, so we need ~D false, meaning D true. So if B true and D true, and C false, expression: (~B ∨ C) false? Wait ~B false, C false, so (~B ∨ C) false. B ∧ ~D is B ∧ ~D = true ∧ false = false. So both false, expression false. So there is a counterexample: B true, D true, C false. In that case, expression is false. But we also need to satisfy other constraints.\n\nSo statement 1 can be false for certain assignments. So we need to check.\n\nBut let's use the equivalence A = (~B ∨ D). Then we must satisfy A ∨ (B · ~D). That is (~B ∨ D) ∨ (B ∧ ~D).\n\nSimplify: (~B ∨ D) ∨ (B ∧ ~D). That's logically equivalent to (~B ∨ D ∨ (B ∧ ~D)). This can be simplified: (~B ∨ D) is already a disjunction. The whole expression is true unless both (~B ∨ D) is false AND (B ∧ ~D) false. For (~B ∨ D) to be false, we need B true and D false. For (B ∧ ~D) to be false, either B false or ~D false (i.e., D true). But B true and D false gives (~D true) so B ∧ ~D true, so second component true. So disjunction true. So it seems the expression is always true. Wait, check other case: maybe B false? Let's systematically test.\n\nLet’s try truth table: There are 4 variables: A, B, C, D. But A is determined by B and D: A = (~B ∨ D). So we only need B, C, D.\n\nSo consider all combinations of B, C, D:\n\nWe'll list B, C, D values, then compute:\n\n- A = (~B ∨ D)\n- Condition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)\n- Condition 2: C ⊃ D\n- Condition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D)\n- Condition 4: A ≡ (~B ∨ D) (always true by construction).\n\nSo we just check conditions 1, 2, 3 for each assignment. Let's generate.\n\nCase 1: B=T, C=T, D=T.\n\nThen ~B=F, D=T => A= F ∨ T = T. So A=T.\n\nCondition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C). ~B ∨ C = F ∨ T = T. So A ⊃ T = T.\n\nCondition 2: C ⊃ D: T ⊃ T = T.\n\nCondition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D) = T ∨ (T ∧ F) = T ∨ F = T.\n\nAll true. So this valuation satisfies all.\n\nSo we have a consistent valuation: B=1, C=1, D=1, A=1.\n\nThus the set is consistent.\n\nNow the question: Which option matches a consistent valuation given? We have options:\n\nB: Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false.\nC: Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false.\nD: Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false.\n\nWe found a valuation where B=1, C=1, D=1, A=1. Option D says C and D true, A and B false. That doesn't match: A false? No, A true. Option C says A, B, D true, C false. Our C true, not false. Option B says A and D true, B and C false. Not match. None match our found valuation.\n\nBut maybe there is a consistent valuation that matches one of those options. Let's check each option's valuation to see if they satisfy all statements.\n\nOption B valuation: A=1, D=1, B=0, C=0.\n\nCompute:\n\nB=0 => ~B =1. D=1 => A = (~B ∨ D) = 1 ∨ 1 =1. So A=1 matches.\n\nNow check Condition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C). ~B ∨ C = 1 ∨ 0 =1. So A ⊃ 1 = 1. Good.\n\nCondition 2: C ⊃ D: 0 ⊃ 1 = 1. Good.\n\nCondition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D) = 1 ∨ (0 ∧ 0) = 1. Good. So all conditions true. So Option B's valuation is consistent. So option B is correct.\n\nThus answer: B.\n\nTherefore the final answer should be \"B\". But the instructions say \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" The last question is the multiple-choice question about consistency.

Actually ~ (A ∨ B) = ~A ∧ ~B. So ~ (~Q ∨ R) = ~~Q ∧ ~R = Q ∧ ~R. So third premise gives Q ∧ ~R.

In propositional logic, implication A ⊃ B is equivalent to ¬A ∨ B.\n\nThus: C ⊃ (D ∨ C) ≡ ¬C ∨ (D ∨ C). We can simplify: ¬C ∨ (D ∨ C). That is same as (¬C ∨ D ∨ C). In disjunction, we have (¬C ∨ C ∨ D). The disjunction of C or ¬C is always true. So ¬C ∨ C is tautology (always true). Then tautology ∨ D is also tautology. Thus the formula is a tautology: always true for any truth values of C and D.\n\nAlternatively: Evaluate truth table: If C is true, then D ∨ C is true (since C true). So implication true. If C false, antecedent false, implication true. So always true.\n\nSecond formula: C · ~D. That is conjunction of C and NOT D. Truth table: true only when C true and D false; false otherwise.\n\nTherefore the first is always true, second is sometimes true, sometimes false. They are not logically equivalent. Are they contradictory? Contradictory means they have opposite truth values in all valuations? That would be if one is always true and the other always false. But here second is not always false; it's true in some valuations. So they are not contradictory.\n\nThey are consistent? Consistent means there is at least one valuation where both are true simultaneously. Are there any valuations where both true? First is always true, second can be true when C true & D false. So yes, at least one valuation: C = T, D = F. Then both true. Therefore they are consistent. So answer: C.

The instruction: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we need to output a single character corresponding to answer choice.\n\nWe need to determine whether the argument is valid or invalid, and if invalid, which counterexample fits.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\nPremises:\n1. (T ∧ ¬U) ⊃ ¬W\n2. ¬W ⊃ X\n3. ¬Z ⊃ W\n4. ¬(X ∧ Z)\n\nConclusion:\nT ⊃ U\n\nWe need to check validity: Does from premises, conclusion always true? Let's attempt to find a valuation where premises all true but conclusion false. Conclusion false means T true and U false. So we need T = T, U = F.\n\nGiven T= T, U= F: evaluate premises:\n\nPremise1: (T ∧ ¬U) ⊃ ¬W. Since T true and ¬U is ¬F = T, so antecedent true. Thus we need ¬W true (consequent true). So ¬W must be T => W = F.\n\nPremise2: ¬W ⊃ X. ¬W true, so we need X true.\n\nPremise3: ¬Z ⊃ W. W = F, so antecedent must be false to make implication true: ¬Z false => Z true. So Z = T.\n\nPremise4: ¬(X ∧ Z). X true, Z true, so X∧Z true => ¬(X∧Z) false. That would make premise4 false. So we need to adjust? We need all premises true. So we cannot have both X and Z true simultaneously. But premise2 forced X true. Premise3 forced Z true. So conflict. Maybe we can choose values differently: Let's see if we can find a different assignment where premises true but conclusion false.\n\nWe set T= T, U= F as needed. Premise1: antecedent true, so need ¬W true => W=F.\n\nPremise2: ¬W ⊃ X. ¬W true so need X true.\n\nPremise3: ¬Z ⊃ W. W=F. For implication to be true, either ¬Z false (i.e., Z true) or W true. Since W false, we need ¬Z false => Z true. So Z true.\n\nPremise4: ¬(X ∧ Z). X true, Z true => false. So impossible. So we can't satisfy all premises with T true, U false. So maybe premises cannot all be true with T true, U false. So maybe the argument is valid. But we must consider other possibilities? Let's check systematically: We need premises all true, conclusion false. We set T true, U false as needed. We found that leads to contradiction. So maybe no counterexample; conclusion always holds. But we should test if there's another assignment with conclusion false? Conclusion false only when T true and U false. So we need to test all possibilities for W, X, Z to satisfy premises.\n\nLet's attempt to see if there is any assignment with T=T, U=F, W=?, X=?, Z=?, satisfying all premises.\n\nPremise1 forces W=F.\n\nPremise2 forces X true (since ¬W true). So X=T.\n\nPremise3: Since W=F, antecedent ¬Z must be false -> Z=T. So Z=T.\n\nPremise4: ¬(X ∧ Z) = ¬(T ∧ T) = ¬T = F. So impossible. So no assignment.\n\nThus premises can't all be true with T true, U false. So conclusion may be valid.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that conclusion false can also happen if T false? Wait, conclusion T ⊃ U is false only when antecedent true (T true) and consequent false (U false). If T false, conclusion is true. So only that case matters. So we found no counterexample. Thus argument is valid.\n\nThus answer: A. Valid.\n\nBut let's double-check there is not other subtlety: maybe we mis-evaluated some premise. Let's re-evaluate premise1: (T ∧ ¬U) ⊃ ¬W. If T true, U false -> ¬U true -> antecedent true. So we need ¬W true: W false.\n\nPremise2: ¬W ⊃ X: with W false, ¬W true => X must be true.\n\nPremise3: ¬Z ⊃ W: with W false, need ¬Z false => Z true.\n\nPremise4: ¬(X ∧ Z): with X true, Z true, false. So unsatisfiable. So indeed no counterexample. So argument is valid.\n\nThus answer: \"A\".\n\nBut the prompt: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we output \"A\" (since answer choice A is valid). However the answer key might have different labeling? The options: A. Valid, B. Invalid. Counterexample when T, X, and Z are true and U and W are false, C. Invalid. Counterexample when T and X are true and U, W, and Z are false, D. Invalid. Counterexample when T, W, and Z are true and U and X are false.\n\nThus answer is A.

They wrote \"Nd\" - maybe the predicate N(x) means \"x is in New York City\"? But then Nd would be \"Delilah is in New York City\" because the subject is D? Actually the letter D might be a constant for Delilah. So Nd would be \"N(d)\", but they wrote Nd. So that means 'N' is predicate for 'is in New York City', d is constant for Delilah.

The last question: \"Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences.\" The formula is ~ (A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E). Then options A-D. The answer is not given. We need to choose the best translation. Let's analyze: ~ (A ⊃ B) is \"not (A implies B)\" which is equivalent to A & ~B. So that says: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book AND Izzy does not play Minecraft. The second part: (B ⊃ ~E) is \"If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by.\" That's B -> ~E. So combined: (A & ~B) & (B -> ~E). So the English: \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy does not play Minecraft, and if Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by.\" But we might rephrase: \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, and also if Izzy does play Minecraft then Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" That is option A? Let's check options:\n\nA. \"It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" This says \"~(A ⊃ B)\" and \"(B ⊃ ~E)\". That matches the formula: It's not the case that A entails B, but B entails ~E. That is a literal translation. Option A matches logically. Option B: \"If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, which entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" That would be (~A ⊃ B) & (B ⊃ ~E) which is different. Option C: \"Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" The second part \"but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by\" seems like \"B ⊃ ~E\"? Wait \"provided that\" means \"if\" so B -> ~E. That's correct. First part: \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" is \"~(A ⊃ B)\". So option C also matches formula. Option D: \"It's not true that Marina reads a Percy Jackson book only when Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by.\" That's \"¬(A ⊃ B)\" & \"(B ⊃ E)\"? Actually \"Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by\" means B ⊃ E, not B ⊃ ~E. So D wrong.\n\nSo options A and C both appear correct? Let's compare wording: Option A says \"but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" Option C says \"but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" Both convey same meaning. But option A says \"doesn't entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by\" maybe misreading? Wait \"does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by\" is B ⊃ ~E, correct. Option A: \"Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" Yes same. Option C: \"Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" That is also B ⊃ ~E. So both correct. However check nuance: Option A says \"it's not the case that Marina's reading ... entails that Izzy plays Minecraft\" which is correct. Option C says \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" same. Both correct. But maybe one is more natural? Option A uses \"does entail\" vs \"provided that\" is maybe less formal but still correct.\n\nMaybe the answer expected is A or C. Which one is better? The formula: ~(A⊃B) • (B⊃¬E). Option A: \"It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" This uses the structure \"not the case that... but... does entail\". Option C: \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\" The first part \"does not entail\" matches. The second \"provided that\" matches. Both are equivalent. The difference: Option A uses \"does entail\" after \"but\". Option C uses \"provided that\" which is more natural? The question: \"Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences.\" They probably expect a direct translation: \"~(A⊃B) • (B⊃¬E)\" -> \"It is not the case that (Marina reads a Percy Jackson book implies Izzy plays Minecraft) and (if Izzy plays Minecraft then Ashleigh doesn't stop by).\" But they gave options with \"but\" connecting. Option A matches that. Option C matches too. Which is considered best? Option A is more direct: \"It's not the case that ... but ... does entail that ...\" Option C: \"but ... provided that ...\". Both are fine.\n\nPerhaps the expected answer is A because it matches the logical connectives more directly: \"~(A⊃B)\" is \"it's not the case that A⊃B.\" Option C \"Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" is also correct but less direct? Wait \"~(A⊃B)\" is indeed \"It is not the case that (A⊃B)\". So option A says exactly that. Option C says \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft.\" This is also a natural way. But which one is considered more correct? The phrase \"does not entail\" is semantically equivalent. The question: \"Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences.\" The key mapping is provided: A: Marina reads..., B: Izzy plays..., etc. The translation should use those names. Option C uses \"Marina's reading ... does not entail ...\" Option A uses \"Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that ...\". That is correct. I think both are acceptable, but maybe one is wrong: Option C says \"Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" which matches ~ (A ⊃ B). But ~ (A ⊃ B) is equivalent to A & ¬B. The phrase \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" is indeed equivalent to not (A ⊃ B). But note that ~ (A⊃B) means not (if A then B). The statement \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" means it's not the case that (A ⊃ B). That is correct. So both.\n\nBut perhaps they expect the most literal translation: \"~(A ⊃ B)\" -> \"It's not the case that if Marina reads ... then Izzy plays Minecraft.\" That is similar to option A's phrasing: \"It's not the case that Marina's reading ... entails that Izzy plays Minecraft.\" Option C: \"Marina's reading ... does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft\" also fits.\n\nI think the answer is A or C. Which one is more likely? Maybe option A because it uses \"but\" connecting both clauses, and \"does entail\" matches second part. Option C uses \"provided that\" but not \"does entail\". I think option A is the better translation. So answer: A.", "predicted_answer": "A", "correct_answer": "A", "is_correct": true, "ai_time_seconds": 8.76}

Let's analyze.\n\nPremises: 1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ C\n2. C ⊃ ~D\nConclusion: D ⊃ A\n\nWe can check with truth tables or reasoning. We want to see if conclusion must follow from premises.\n\nWe can check potential counterexample: find truth assignment making premises true and conclusion false. Conclusion false means D true and A false. So D is true, A is false. Then for premises: 1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ C: with A false, so A ∨ B reduces to B. So need (B) ⊃ C to be true. That requires either B false or C true. So if B false, premise true regardless of C. If B true, then need C true. So we can choose B false.\n\nPremise 2: C ⊃ ~D: With D true, ~D false. So C ⊃ false is false unless C false. Actually implication X ⊃ Y is false only when X true and Y false. So we need X true (C true) and Y false (~D false). So if C true, premise 2 false. If C false, premise 2 true. So to satisfy premises, we need C false. That makes premise 1: (B) ⊃ false: If B is true, then false is implication false (since antecedent true, consequent false). So premise 1 would be false if B true. So we need B false. So far we have D true, A false, C false, B false. Check premise 1: (A ∨ B) ⊃ C => (false ∨ false) ⊃ false => false ⊃ false => true. Because implication with false antecedent is true. Good. Premise 2: C ⊃ ~D => false ⊃ ~true (which is false) => false ⊃ false => true. So both premises true. Conclusion D ⊃ A: true ⊃ false => false. So we found a counterexample: A false, B false, C false, D true.\n\nWhich option matches? Option D says: \"Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are false and D is true.\" That's exactly what we found. Option B says: \"Invalid. Counterexample when B, C, and D are true and A is false\". That would be A false, B true, C true, D true. Let's test that assignment: A false, B true, C true, D true. Premise 1: (A ∨ B) ⊃ C => (false ∨ true) ⊃ true => true ⊃ true => true. Premise 2: C ⊃ ~D => true ⊃ false => false. So premise 2 false. So not counterexample. Option C: \"Invalid. Counterexample when B and D are true and A and C are false.\" A false, B true, C false, D true. Premise 1: (false ∨ true) ⊃ false => true ⊃ false => false. So premises not satisfied. So invalid.

So can't derive P.\n\nWe could derive N ⊃ ~O? Let's see. From 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). If we had P, we could derive N ⊃ ~O. But we don't have P.\n\nBut maybe we can derive (N ⊃ ~O) by transitivity? Actually, if we know P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O) and we have P (we don't), can't.\n\nAlternatively, from Premise 1: (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q). If we had (N ⊃ ~O), we could get O ∨ Q.\n\nBut we can't derive N ⊃ ~O.\n\nLet's examine possible one-step consequences: Option A: P. Can we get P from premises? We have N ⊃ P. Without N, can't.

But we don't have N ⊃ ~O.\n\nOption D: ~P. We can maybe derive ~P? If we had N ⊃ P and we had N? But not. So none directly.\n\nWait maybe there's a hidden immediate consequence: Suppose we consider the chain: From Premise 3: N ⊃ P. From Premise 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). So by hypothetical syllogism? Actually from 3 and 2 we can derive N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). That's not a standard inference. But maybe we can use the rule of transposition? Not.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the premise 1 as a conditional with antecedent (N ⊃ ~O). If we can derive (N ⊃ ~O) via a combination of premises 2 and 3? Wait we have P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). If we can prove P, then we get N ⊃ ~O. But we cannot prove P.\n\nSo no one-step consequence seems obvious.\n\nBut the question might assume that immediate consequence means you can use Modus Ponens or Modus Tollens with a single premise. Let's examine each option with each premise:\n\n- Option A: P. Which premise can give P? None. Modus ponens: from P ⊃ ... you need P as antecedent, not available. Modus tollens: from ... ⊃ P we need not ... . No.\n\n- Option B: N ⊃ ~O. Which premise gives that? P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). That's an antecedent that is a conditional. No.\n\n- Option C: O ∨ Q. Which premise gives that? (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q). That's a conditional with antecedent N ⊃ ~O.\n\n- Option D: ~P. Which premise? N ⊃ P? No. Also maybe we can use contrapositive of 3: ~P ⊃ ~N. But that's not given. So none.\n\nPerhaps the best is \"N ⊃ ~O\" is immediate consequence? Wait from Premise 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). If we apply the rule of hypothetical syllogism to Premise 3? Actually, we could apply the rule that from (P ⊃ Q) and (Q ⊃ R) we can get (P ⊃ R). But we need P ⊃ Q, Q ⊃ R. But we have N ⊃ P and P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). So by chaining we can get N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). That is not N ⊃ ~O though.\n\nBut we might be able to use the rule of \"transposition\" on 3: N ⊃ P is equivalent to ~P ⊃ ~N. But that gives ~P ⊃ ~N. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the immediate consequence might be \"N ⊃ P\" is given. But it's a premise. Wait maybe we misread: The question: \"Which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?\" They give premises: (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q) ; P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O); N ⊃ P.\n\nSo an immediate consequence means from these premises we can derive something by one inference step, like modus ponens, modus tollens, simplification, or addition, etc.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n- If we apply Modus Ponens to Premise 1, we need N ⊃ ~O. We don't have that yet.\n\n- Modus Ponens to Premise 2: we need P. We don't have P.\n\n- Modus Ponens to Premise 3: we need N. We don't have N.\n\nSo we cannot do Modus Ponens.\n\nWhat about Modus Tollens? For premise 1: (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q). If we had ~ (O ∨ Q), we could infer ~ (N ⊃ ~O). Not helpful.\n\nPremise 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). If we had ~ (N ⊃ ~O), we could infer ~P. Not given.\n\nPremise 3: N ⊃ P. If we had ~P, we could infer ~N. But ~P not given.\n\nSo no Modus Tollens.\n\nOther one-step rules: Simplification of conjunction, addition of conjunction. None.\n\nThus none of the options is immediate. But perhaps the intended answer is \"O ∨ Q\". Let's double-check: If we apply Modus Ponens to premise 1, we need N ⊃ ~O. But we can derive N ⊃ ~O via Modus Ponens on premise 2? Wait, from P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O) we need P to get N ⊃ ~O. We don't have P. But perhaps we can derive P by Modus Ponens on premise 3 if we had N. But we don't have N either.\n\nSo indeed not immediate.\n\nHowever, the answer might be ~P (option D) via Modus Tollens from premise 3: If N ⊃ P and we had ~N? Wait, we don't have ~N. But maybe we can derive ~N from premise 1? Actually from (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q), if O ∨ Q is false, we get ~ (N ⊃ ~O). That is equivalent to N ∧ O. Not helpful.\n\nThus none.\n\nMaybe the intention was to allow \"immediate consequence\" meaning you can derive using any inference rule, not necessarily single step. But then which one is derivable? Let's see if we can derive any of the options:\n\n- Can we derive P? Suppose we try to derive P: We have N ⊃ P. If we had N, we could get P. But we don't. However, maybe we can derive N from premises? Let's see: From premise 1, if O ∨ Q is true, we can't get N. From premise 2, if N ⊃ ~O is true, we get O ∨ Q. But again.\n\nBut maybe we can derive P by transitivity: N ⊃ P and P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). This doesn't give P.\n\n- Can we derive N ⊃ ~O? Suppose we apply transitivity: From 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). If we combine with 3: N ⊃ P, we can get N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). That's a weaker form. But not exactly N ⊃ ~O.\n\n- Can we derive O ∨ Q? Suppose we can get N ⊃ ~O. We can't.\n\n- Can we derive ~P? Suppose we have N ⊃ P and ~N. But we don't have ~N.\n\nThus none of them are derivable.\n\nSo maybe the answer is D: ~P because it's the only one not derived but perhaps contradictory to something else? But no.\n\nWait maybe the \"immediate consequence\" is \"N ⊃ P\"? But that's a premise, not an option.\n\nLet's check the options: A. P; B. N ⊃ ~O; C. O ∨ Q; D. ~P.\n\nWhich one can be derived by modus ponens from premise 2 if we had P? We can't.\n\nBut maybe we can derive ~P by Modus Tollens from premise 3 if we have ~N. But we don't.\n\nSo none.\n\nHowever, perhaps the answer is B: N ⊃ ~O, because we can apply the inference rule: Modus Ponens with 2 and 3? Wait, 3 gives N ⊃ P. 2 gives P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). By the rule of transitivity: if N ⊃ P and P ⊃ Q, we can get N ⊃ Q. So we can derive N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). But that's not N ⊃ ~O. But maybe the teacher considered that as \"immediate consequence\" because they think of transitivity as a single step. But they might be sloppy.\n\nBut maybe we can do a more direct derivation: From premise 3, we have N ⊃ P. Using the rule \"hypothetical syllogism\", we can chain with premise 2: P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). Then we get N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). This is indeed one step (hypothetical syllogism). But that's not option B.\n\nBut we can then apply the rule \"implication introduction\" maybe to simplify? Not.\n\nSo I think the question might be flawed. But maybe the intended answer is D: ~P because it is immediate by Modus Tollens from premise 3 if we had ~N, but we don't.\n\nLet's consider if any of the options could be obtained by using the inference rule \"Conditional proof\" or something like that. But that's not one step.\n\nThus I'd answer: None of the options are immediate consequences. But since they ask to choose, we need to pick one. Perhaps the correct answer is \"None of the above.\" But that's not an option.\n\nMaybe the best choice is C: O ∨ Q. Because from 2 and 3 we can derive N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). But from that we can apply 1: If N ⊃ ~O then O ∨ Q. But we don't have N ⊃ ~O. However, if we had N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O), maybe we could derive O ∨ Q? Wait, if N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O) is equivalent to N ⊃ ~O. Because N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O) is logically equivalent to (N ∧ N) ⊃ ~O? Actually, (N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O)) is a tautology equivalent to N ⊃ ~O. Because if N is true, then N ⊃ ~O must be true. But if N is false, N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O) is true. So overall it's equivalent to N ⊃ ~O. So we can actually derive N ⊃ ~O from the premises. But that's not one step though.\n\nBut maybe the teacher considered that as a single inference: from premise 3 and 2 using hypothetical syllogism, we get N ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). Then we apply a tautological equivalence to get N ⊃ ~O. That might be considered one step? Unlikely.\n\nLet's assume the answer is B: N ⊃ ~O. Because it's the one that appears in the premises and is needed for the rest.\n\nThus I'll answer B.", "predicted_answer": "B", "correct_answer": "A", "is_correct": false, "ai_time_seconds": 17.8}

Inconsistent\nAnswer:\"\n\nWe need to answer with a single character. So we need to find the correct answer letter.\n\nWe need to analyze the logical relationship between two expressions: I ≡ ~H and ~(~I ≡ H). Determine if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, or neither.\n\nLet's analyze.\n\nLet p = I, q = H.\n\nExpression 1: p ≡ ~q (i.e., p iff not q). That's true when p and ~q have same truth value: i.e., (p ∧ ~q) ∨ (~p ∧ q). Equivalent to (p XOR q) but with negation: Actually equivalence of p and ¬q is equivalent to p ⊕ q (exclusive or). Wait, equivalence (↔) means they have same truth value. So p iff ¬q: both true or both false. When is both true? p true and ¬q true => p true, q false. Both false? p false and ¬q false => p false, q true. So truth table: p q => p≡~q: T if (T,F) or (F,T). So it's exclusive or: true when p and q are different. So expression 1 is true when p and q have opposite truth values.\n\nExpression 2: ~(~p ≡ q). So first ~p ≡ q: that's equivalence of ~p and q: true when ~p and q are same: i.e., both true or both false. Cases: ~p true (p false) and q true => p false, q true. Or ~p false (p true) and q false => p true, q false. So ~p ≡ q is true when (p false, q true) or (p true, q false). That's again exclusive or: ~p ≡ q is equivalent to p XOR q. Then we take negation: ~(~p ≡ q) is false when (p XOR q) is true, true otherwise. So ~(~p ≡ q) is equivalent to ¬(p ⊕ q). That is equivalence: it's true when p and q have same value: (p true, q true) or (p false, q false). So expression 2 is the equivalence p ↔ q (i.e., p ≡ q). Wait check: ~(~p ≡ q) is same as p ≡ q? Let's verify.\n\np ≡ q is true when both same: (T,T) or (F,F). We found ~(~p ≡ q) is true when p and q same: yes same. So expression 2 is equivalent to p ≡ q.\n\nThus expression 1 is p ≡ ¬q. Expression 2 is p ≡ q.\n\nAre they logically equivalent? No, because one is true when p and q opposite, other when same. Are they contradictory? Contradictory means one true iff other false in all interpretations. Let's check: For pair p T, q T: expression1 is false, expression2 is true -> opposite. For p T, q F: expression1 true, expression2 false. For p F, q T: expression1 true, expression2 false. Wait expression1 true when p false, q true? Yes expression1 is true when p false, q true. So expression1 true, expression2 false. For p F, q F: expression1 false, expression2 true. So in all four assignments, the truth values are opposite: one is true when other false. That means they are contradictory. Because for each interpretation, one is true and other false. Yes contradictory.

Consistent valuation when W and X are true and T and U are false D. Consistent. Consistent valuation when T and U are true and W and X are false\"\n\nWe need to decide which option is correct. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have three propositions:\n\n1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)\n2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)\n3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W\n\nWe need to find whether there exists an assignment of truth values to T,U,W,X that makes all three statements true. If yes, consistent. If no, inconsistent.\n\nWe need to test options.\n\nLet's analyze logically.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nA = (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)\nB = T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)\nC = (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W\n\nWe need all A,B,C true.\n\nWe can analyze systematically.\n\nRecall: P ⊃ Q is equivalent to ~P ∨ Q.\n\nThus:\n\nA: ~(T ⊃ U) ∨ (W ⊃ U). Since P ⊃ Q = ~P ∨ Q. So T ⊃ U = ~T ∨ U. So ~(T ⊃ U) = ~(~T ∨ U) = T ∧ ~U. And W ⊃ U = ~W ∨ U. So A: (T ∧ ~U) ∨ (~W ∨ U). That's A.\n\nSimplify: A is equivalent to (T ∧ ~U) ∨ ~W ∨ U. Which is logically equivalent to (~W) ∨ U ∨ (T ∧ ~U). That's a tautology? Let's see: (~W ∨ U) is a clause. Then OR with (T ∧ ~U). So A is equivalent to (~W ∨ U ∨ (T ∧ ~U)). This is true unless ~W is false and U is false and (T ∧ ~U) false. Let's find counterexample: If W true (so ~W false), U false, then we need (T ∧ ~U) true? But ~U is true because U false, so T ∧ true = T. So if T is true, then A true. If T false, then (T ∧ ~U) false. Then A false. So A is false when W true, U false, T false. Also if W true, U false, T true: A true. If W true, U true: then U true => A true. If W false: ~W true => A true regardless of others. So A is false only in the specific scenario: W=T=?? Wait, we need W true, U false, T false. So that scenario: T=F, U=F, W=T. Then A false.\n\nNow B: T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X). Evaluate: U ⊃ X = ~U ∨ X. So ~(U ⊃ X) = ~(~U ∨ X) = U ∧ ~X. So B: T ⊃ (U ∧ ~X). Equivalent to ~T ∨ (U ∧ ~X). So B true unless T true and (U ∧ ~X) false. That is, B false if T true and (U ∧ ~X) false (i.e., either U false or ~X false i.e., X true). So B false if T true and (U is false or X true). So B false when T true, U false, or T true, X true (regardless of U). Actually B false if T true AND (U∧~X) false. That means either U false OR ~X false => X true. So B false if T true AND (U false or X true). Equivalent: if T true and (U false or X true). That covers T true, U false (regardless X). Also T true, X true (regardless U). But careful: T true, U false, X false: B false (since U false). T true, U true, X true: B false. T true, U true, X false: B true (since U true, ~X true). So B is false in many cases.\n\nNow C: (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W. T ⊃ ~X = ~T ∨ ~X. So C: (~(T ⊃ ~X)) ∨ W = ~(~T ∨ ~X) ∨ W = (T ∧ X) ∨ W. So C true unless (T ∧ X) false and W false. So C false only when W false and (T ∧ X) false. When is (T ∧ X) false? When T false or X false. So C false when W false AND (T false OR X false). That's same as: if W false AND (T false OR X false). So C true if W true OR (T true AND X true). So C false in scenarios where W false and (T false or X false). Let's test.\n\nNow we need all three true simultaneously. Let's try to find assignment.\n\nWe can try to satisfy A and B first.\n\nFrom earlier, A false only when W true, U false, T false. So to keep A true, avoid that combination.\n\nWe also need B true. B false when T true AND (U false OR X true). So B true requires either T false, or T true AND (U true AND X false). So B true when (T false) OR (T true AND U true AND X false). Let's denote B condition.\n\nC true when W true OR (T true AND X true). So we need either W true or (T true and X true).\n\nLet's attempt to find assignment that satisfies all.\n\nOption B says: consistent when U,W,X true and T false. Let's test that: U=T? Wait U true, W true, X true, T false. Check each:\n\nA: Evaluate: A = (T ∧ ~U) ∨ (~W ∨ U). Since T false, T∧~U false. (~W ∨ U) = (~true ∨ true) = (false ∨ true) = true. So A true.\n\nB: T ⊃ (U ∧ ~X). T false, so antecedent false, so B true. Good.\n\nC: (T ∧ X) ∨ W = (false ∧ true) ∨ true = false ∨ true = true. So all three true. So consistent. Option B suggests consistent. Option B: consistent with U,W,X true, T false. That works. So the set is consistent.

The instruction from developer says \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we need to output the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) that corresponds to the correct answer to last question.\n\nWe need to interpret the formula ~C ∨ D in natural English. The key: A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book. B: Izzy plays Minecraft. C: Emily stops working. D: Russell makes dinner. E: Ashleigh stops by.\n\nFormula ~C ∨ D means \"not C or D\".

Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\nC. Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\nD. Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\nWe have ~C ∨ D. This is equivalent to C → D. Because (~C ∨ D) is implication C -> D. So the natural phrase is \"If Emily stops working then Russell makes dinner.\" But the options are phrased as \"If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner\" etc. We need to map.\n\nC: \"Emily stops working\" (C). So \"If Emily stops working then Russell makes dinner\" would be \"C ⊃ D\" or \"If Emily stops working then Russell makes dinner.\" However the formula given is ~C ∨ D. Wait ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, but the question might be to translate formula into natural sentences. But we need to choose from given options that best match ~C ∨ D.\n\nOption A: \"If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner.\" That's ~C → D. That is not the same as ~C ∨ D. Because ~C → D is equivalent to C ∨ D. Actually ~C → D is (C ∨ D). Let's check: P→Q is ~P ∨ Q. So ~C ∨ D is indeed C → D, not ~C → D. So Option A is wrong.\n\nOption B: \"Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\" The phrase \"unless\" is ambiguous: \"p unless q\" is usually equivalent to \"not q → p\" or \"p ∨ q\" (?), but typical logic: \"P unless Q\" means if not Q, then P. That is ~Q → P, i.e., Q ∨ P. But our formula ~C ∨ D is C → D. So not matching.\n\nOption C: \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\" That is \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\" This is \"If Russell does make dinner then Emily stops working?\" Wait \"unless\" can be ambiguous. \"P unless Q\" often means \"if not Q then P\". So \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\" So let P= \"Emily stops working\" (C), Q = \"Russell doesn't make dinner\" (~D). So \"C unless ~D\" means if D then C? Because not Q is not (~D) which is D. So if Russell makes dinner, then Emily stops working: D → C. That is equivalent to ~D ∨ C. That's not ~C ∨ D.\n\nOption D: \"Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\" Here P = \"Emily doesn't stop working\" (~C). Q = \"Russell makes dinner\" D. \"P unless Q\" means if not Q then P, i.e., ~D → ~C, which is C ∨ ~D. That is equivalent to C ∨ ~D. This is not our formula.\n\nThus none of the given match? Wait maybe \"unless\" can also be interpreted differently. Let's examine the logic equivalences: \"unless\" is usually interpreted as \"P unless Q\" meaning \"not Q implies P\". So P ←¬Q. That is P ∨ Q. Indeed \"P unless Q\" is equivalent to \"Q ∨ P\". So for each option:\n\nOption A: \"If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner.\" That is ~C → D = C ∨ D. That matches formula? No, formula is ~C ∨ D = C → D. So different.\n\nOption B: \"Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\" This is \"C unless D\" -> C ∨ D. That matches? Actually C ∨ D is ~C → D? No, C ∨ D is equivalent to ~C → D. So this is not formula either.\n\nOption C: \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\" This is C unless ~D -> C ∨ ~D = D → C. Not formula.\n\nOption D: \"Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\" This is ~C unless D -> ~C ∨ D = ~C ∨ D. Wait check: ~C unless D: P = ~C, Q = D. P unless Q -> P ∨ Q = ~C ∨ D.

Here Bx is chocolate chips? Actually Bx stands for \"has chocolate chips\"? We need context: likely Cx= is a cookie, Ox=has oatmeal, Bx=has chocolate chips, Og= is? Wait \"Og\" is maybe \"is a cookie\" but with g? Actually Og is \"cookie g has oatmeal\"? No.\n\nIn the options, Bx is chocolate chips. Og is? In the argument, they say \"If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.\" They mention \"this cookie\" but it's ambiguous. The conclusion is ~Og. That is \"not O_g\"? g is a constant? Actually they use g as a constant? In earlier question they used g: George, h: Hector etc. Here they use g? No g is a constant, but they say ~Og, meaning \"not O of g\" meaning \"g does not have oatmeal\" presumably. But we don't know.\n\nWait the statement: ∀x [ (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og ]. This says: For all x, if (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) then ~Og. So the antecedent is a statement about any x: (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx). But the consequent is ~Og, which refers to the constant g. So the whole formula is: If for any x, (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) holds, then ~Og. Actually it's universal: ∀x [ (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og ]. So for each x, if (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) then ~Og. This is equivalent to: If (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) then ~Og for all x. So effectively (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) → ~Og, for each x. But that doesn't connect x with g. The conclusion is about g, a particular object. So the inference is: from the premise that for all x, if (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) then ~Og, we deduce ~Og. But the first premise says that there exists a cookie with oatmeal. So the argument: There is some cookie that has oatmeal. For all x, if (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) then ~Og. So if (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) for each x, then ~Og. So presumably we conclude ~Og. So the English: \"Some cookies have oatmeal. If for any object, not a cookie implies not chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.\" Actually no, the conclusion is ~Og.

Let's analyze.\n\nWe have 4 variables: N, O, P, Q.\n\nFirst statement: ~N ≡ (O · P). That is equivalence: ~N ↔ (O & P). So either both sides true or both false. So ~N true iff (O & P) true. So ~N true when N is false. So N false ↔ O & P true. So N false implies O & P true. And N true implies O & P false.\n\nSecond: ~O ⊃ Q. That is implication: if not O then Q. Equivalent to O ∨ Q. So if O is false, Q must be true. If O true, no restriction.\n\nThird: N & ~Q. So N true and Q false.\n\nFrom third, N = true, Q = false. So N true. Then from first, N true implies O & P false. So O & P false. So at least one of O, P is false.\n\nGiven Q false. Check second: ~O ⊃ Q. Since Q false, we need to check ~O must be false (to avoid false implication). For implication (~O → Q) to be true with Q false, ~O must be false, i.e., ~O false means O true. So O must be true.\n\nNow O true. Then O & P must be false, but O true, so P must be false. So we have N true, O true, P false, Q false. Does first hold? ~N ≡ (O & P). ~N is ~true = false. O & P = true & false = false. So false ≡ false true. Good.\n\nSecond holds: ~O ⊃ Q. ~O = false.

Need to determine.\n\nWe need to evaluate validity of argument: Premise: (O ≡ P) ∨ P. Conclusion: P ∨ ~O. Determine if always true? Let's analyze.\n\nWe can use logic: (O ≡ P) is (O↔P). Equivalent to (O∧P) ∨ (~O∧~P). So premise: ((O∧P) ∨ (~O∧~P)) ∨ P. This simplifies: P ∨ ((O∧P) ∨ (~O∧~P)). Since P ∨ (anything that has P or not). If P is true, premise true. If P false, then premise reduces to (~O∧~P) because O∧P false when P false. So when P false, premise is (~O∧~P). So premise is true if P true, or if P false and O false.\n\nConclusion: P ∨ ~O. So conclusion is true if P true or O false. So analyze cases:\n\nCase 1: P true. Premise true. Conclusion true. So fine.\n\nCase 2: P false. Then premise true iff O false. Conclusion true iff O false (since P false, need ~O). So for P false and O false, both true. For P false and O true, premise false (since (~O∧~P) false, and P false, so whole premise false). So premise false, no need to check conclusion. The argument is valid if whenever premise true conclusion true. We have seen in all cases where premise true (P true, or P false & O false) conclusion true. So the argument is valid.\n\nThus answer A: Valid.

The last question is: \"Select the best translation into predicate logic: Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name. A. Sk ≡ Bl B. Bl ≡ Sk C. Bx ⊃ Sy D.

We need to decide which is correct translation.\n\nWe need to parse: \"Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" Variables: presumably Bx means x is bad. Sk means S? Maybe \"Sx\" means \"DJ Khaled shouts x\"? But the options use S and B. Let's parse each option.\n\nOption A: Sk ≡ Bl. This means Sk is equivalent to Bl. So \"S(k) ≡ B(l)\"? Actually Sk probably means \"S(k)\" with k being a constant for DJ Khaled? Wait we need to figure what the letters are: Sk, Bl. The problem statement: \"Select the best translation into predicate logic: Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" The variables: maybe Sx = \"DJ Khaled shouts x's name\"? Bx = \"x is bad\"? k is maybe a constant for Leroy? But Sk: S(k). So \"DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name\"? That is Sk. Bl: B(l) maybe means \"Leroy is bad\"? But the letter l may be a constant for Leroy. But we have Sk ≡ Bl, meaning \"DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name if and only if Leroy is bad.\" That is too strong; it's biconditional, not just only if.\n\nOption B: Bl ≡ Sk. Same as A but reversed. Also too strong.\n\nOption C: Bx ⊃ Sy. This says \"if Bx then Sy.\" But we don't have constants; maybe Bx means x is bad; Sy means \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\"? Actually Sx might mean \"DJ Khaled shouts x's name.\" So \"if someone is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" That seems wrong.\n\nOption D: Bl ⊃ Sk. That says \"If Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" That matches \"Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" The phrase \"P only if Q\" means P ⊃ Q.

Q is \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\" i.e. S? But we need a constant for \"his name\". The constant for Leroy is maybe l? So S(l). But we don't have S(l) in options, we have Sk. That might be S(k) meaning \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\"? Wait k might be a constant for DJ Khaled? No, maybe the S predicate is \"DJ Khaled shouts x\" and x is a person. But the subject is \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\". That could be \"S(Leroy)\" or \"S(l)\" but not S(k). So option D uses Sk. So S(k) means \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\"? That seems odd. But maybe the constant k denotes Leroy. But we need to determine what k stands for: The problem states \"Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.\" The variables: maybe l = Leroy. But in options, they use l and k. There is no explicit definition. But we can assume l denotes Leroy, and k denotes DJ Khaled? Actually no: Option A says Sk ≡ Bl. So Sk is the predicate S applied to k; maybe k is Leroy? But that would be weird because Sk means \"DJ Khaled shouts k's name\", but k might be Leroy. Option B is same reversed.

The previous question used Bxyx: x borrows y from z. For this, we might have Lx meaning x lent? In previous translation, \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar\" would be Lm? That is Lm: Ms. Jackson lent sugar to me? So Lm stands for \"Ms. Jackson lent me sugar\". Then \"neither Janet nor Latoya did\" means \"Janet did not lend me sugar and Latoya did not lend me sugar.\" So ~(Lj ∨ Ll) means \"not (Janet lent me sugar or Latoya lent me sugar)\" which is equivalent to \"neither Janet nor Latoya did.\" So the whole sentence: Lm ∧ ~(Lj ∨ Ll).

Consistent valuation when E and I are true and F, G, H, and J are false\n\nWe need to find if there is a valuation that satisfies all formulas simultaneously. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have four formulas. Let's denote them:\n\n1. (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G\n2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)\n3. I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)\n4. ~G ⊃ ~J\n\nGoal: find assignment of truth values to E, F, G, H, I, J such that all four formulas are true.\n\nLet's analyze systematically.\n\nFirst, recall semantics:\n\n- P ⊃ Q is equivalent to ~P ∨ Q.\n\n- P ≡ Q is equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∨ (~P ∧ ~Q).\n\n- ~G ⊃ ~J means if not G then not J: equivalent to G ∨ ~J? Actually P ⊃ Q is equivalent to ~P ∨ Q. So ~G ⊃ ~J is equivalent to ~(~G) ∨ ~J, which is G ∨ ~J. So that formula is true unless G is false and ~J is false? Wait let's compute: (~G ⊃ ~J) is equivalent to G ∨ ~J. Because (~G ⊃ ~J) = ~(~G) ∨ ~J = G ∨ ~J. So it's equivalent to G ∨ ~J. So formula 4 is true except when G = false and ~J = false, meaning G false and J true. So if G is false, J must be false or else the formula fails.\n\nBut we can treat them directly.\n\nLet's analyze each formula:\n\n1. (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G. This is (~(E ⊃ F)) ∨ G. E ⊃ F is (~E ∨ F). So (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G is equivalent to ~(~E ∨ F) ∨ G = (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G. Because ~(~E ∨ F) is E ∧ ~F. So formula1 is true iff (E ∧ ~F) is true or G is true. So if E true and F false, then G must be true? Wait if E ∧ ~F is true, formula is true regardless of G. If E ∧ ~F is false, then G must be true. So either E is true & F false (then formula true regardless of G), or G true.\n\n2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I). This is equivalence: (~E ∨ F) is same as (E ⊃ F). So we require (~E ∨ F) and (H ∨ I) to have same truth value. So either both true or both false.\n\n3. I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H). This is I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H). Evaluate J ⊃ ~H as (~J ∨ ~H). So I ⊃ (~J ∨ ~H). Equivalent to (~I) ∨ (~J ∨ ~H) = (~I) ∨ (~J) ∨ (~H). So formula3 is true unless I is true and both J and H are true. Because if I true, then need (~J ∨ ~H) true; that fails only if J true and H true. So formula3 fails only when I = true, J = true, H = true.\n\n4. ~G ⊃ ~J is equivalent to G ∨ ~J. So formula4 is true unless G false and J true.\n\nThus constraints:\n\n- If G false, J must be false. Or J can be true if G true? Wait G ∨ ~J. If G true, formula true regardless of J. If G false, then we need ~J true, i.e., J false. So if G false => J false. If G true => J arbitrary.\n\n- If I true, cannot have J true and H true simultaneously. So I true & J true & H true is not allowed.\n\n- Equivalence 2: (~E ∨ F) == (H ∨ I).\n\nWe need to find assignment.\n\nNow we also have formula1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G. So if G false, we need E true & F false. Because formula1 would be false otherwise. But we might set G true to avoid that.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nOption A: Inconsistent. So we need to see if any valuation exists. Let's try to find one.\n\nTry to find assignment consistent with all constraints.\n\nWe can try to satisfy each formula.\n\nLet's choose G true to satisfy formula1 automatically. That eliminates requirement for E ∧ ~F. And also formula4 is automatically true (since G ∨ ~J). So we can set J arbitrary.\n\nNow we need to satisfy formula2 equivalence: (~E ∨ F) == (H ∨ I). Let's pick E, F, H, I accordingly. And formula3: I ⊃ (~J ∨ ~H) (but since formula1 gave G true, no restriction on J, but formula3 restricts if I true).\n\nLet's choose some assignment.\n\nWe can try to find a satisfying assignment with G true.\n\nOption B says: E true, F false, G false, H false, I false, J false. But G false fails formula1 unless E true & F false. Actually G false & E true & F false makes formula1 true. Let's check all formulas for Option B's valuation:\n\n- E true, F false, G false, H false, I false, J false.\n\nFormula1: (E ∧ ~F) ∨ G = (true ∧ true) ∨ false = true ∨ false = true. Good.\n\nFormula2: (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I). (~E ∨ F) = (~true ∨ false) = (false ∨ false) = false. (H ∨ I) = (false ∨ false) = false. Equivalence: false ≡ false -> true. Good.\n\nFormula3: I ⊃ (~J ∨ ~H). I false, so antecedent false, thus formula true. Good.\n\nFormula4: G ∨ ~J = false ∨ true = true. Good.\n\nAll true. So Option B's valuation is consistent. But note Option B says \"Consistent. Consistent valuation when E is true and F, G, H, I, and J are false.\" Indeed that matches what we found.\n\nBut the question: \"Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation.\" Option B seems correct.\n\nWe should double-check that Option B's valuation indeed satisfies all formulas. It does.\n\nTherefore answer: B.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we should output just \"B\".\n\nBut we need to double-check if any other options also have consistent valuations. Option C: E true, H true, others false. Let's test:\n\nE true, F false? Wait Option C says E true and H true and F, G, I, J false. Let's test:\n\nE=true, F=false, G=false, H=true, I=false, J=false.\n\nFormula1: (E∧~F)∨G = true∧true ∨ false = true. Good.\n\nFormula2: (~E∨F) = (~true ∨ false) = false. (H∨I) = true∨false = true. Equivalence false≡true -> false. So formula2 fails. So Option C fails.\n\nOption D: E true, I true, others false. Let's test:\n\nE=true, F=false, G=false, H=false, I=true, J=false.\n\nFormula1: (E∧~F)=true, so formula1 true.\n\nFormula2: (~E∨F) = false; (H∨I)=false∨true= true. Equivalence false≡true => false. So fails.\n\nTherefore Option B is consistent and others not.

For the sixth, they provide options A-D. They didn't give answer. So we need to answer the last question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence? \"Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nWe need to parse the sentence. \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" means: \"If France subsidizes agriculture, then England's importing beef\" is false? Wait, \"necessary condition\" for France's subsidizing agriculture means that for France to subsidize agriculture, England must import beef. So necessary condition: England's importing beef is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture means: If France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef. The negation \"is not a necessary condition\" means the statement is not true that: If France subsidizes, then England imports. So the negation of (F ⊃ E). Wait we need to assign F: France subsidizing agriculture? Actually earlier in question, they used variables: E, F, C, S? They had in options: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) etc. They use F for France's subsidizing agriculture? The first part \"England's importing beef\" variable might be E? But in options they use E for England's importing? Actually they used E in options: (~F ⊃ E). That looks like \"If France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef.\" So F: France subsidizes agriculture, E: England imports beef. So \"~F ⊃ E\" would be: \"If not France subsidizes, then England imports\"? Wait the negation of \"necessary condition\" would be something else. Let's analyze.\n\nThe sentence: \"Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nWe want to express this in propositional logic. The first part: \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\" The necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture: If France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef. The negation: It is NOT the case that (F ⊃ E). So that is ¬(F ⊃ E). But in options they have (~F ⊃ E) etc. That's not the same. ~F ⊃ E would mean \"If France does not subsidize, then England imports.\" That's not the same as \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interpretation: \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" means that England's importing beef is NOT required for France to subsidize agriculture. That could mean: \"If England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture\"?? Actually necessary condition: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" means that if France subsidizes, then England imports. The negation \"is not a necessary condition\" means that it does not hold that (F ⊃ E). So ¬(F ⊃ E). That is equivalent to F ∧ ¬E. Wait, ¬(p ⊃ q) is p ∧ ¬q. So this means France subsidizes agriculture and England does not import beef. That seems plausible: If it's not a necessary condition, then there is a case where France subsidizes but England does not import. So that's a particular state, but the sentence \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" is a proposition about a world. We might represent as ¬(F ⊃ E). Yes.\n\nNow second part: \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\" That is a conditional: If South Africa supplies diamonds, then China promotes human rights. So that would be S ⊃ C, assuming C for China promotes human rights, S for South Africa supplies diamonds. Option D has (S ⊃ C). Option B has (C ⊃ S). Option A uses C ≡ ~S. Option C uses C ≡ S. So the correct representation for \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds\" is \"S ⊃ C\", not \"C ⊃ S\". So Option D uses (S ⊃ C). Good.\n\nNow the overall sentence is a disjunction: either first part OR second part. So we need ¬(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C). Option D is ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C). That matches.

We need to translate to natural English. The options: \nA: \"Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft.\" That says (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary condition for (D ∧ ~B).

From C ∨ D and ~C, by Disjunctive Syllogism (not one-step maybe? But D can be derived as the remaining disjunct: if C ∨ D and ~C then D. That is a rule (Disjunctive Syllogism) but it uses two premises: C ∨ D and ~C. So it's still one step from the premises? The problem says immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises. Typically, an immediate consequence is a proposition that can be inferred from the premises using a single inference rule, perhaps using any number of premises. But the typical notion of immediate consequence: a formula that can be derived from the premises by applying a single rule of inference. The rule may involve multiple premises. For example, from (P ∨ Q) and ~P you can infer Q by DS. So that would be immediate. So from premises we can get C ∨ D by MP, and then with ~C we can get D by DS. But that would require two inference steps: first MP to get C ∨ D, then DS to get D. But if we combine? Wait, we might derive D directly? Let's see if there is a rule that from (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D), A ∨ B, and ~C we can derive D by a single inference? We could apply MP to get C ∨ D, then DS with ~C to get D. That is two steps. But is there a direct rule? No. So maybe the question expects the answer \"D. (A ∨ B) ⊃ D\" is immediate? Let's test: Is (A ∨ B) ⊃ D an immediate consequence? We might think: from the premises, we cannot derive that (A ∨ B) ⊃ D because we don't have that. So no.\n\nOption C: \"C ∨ D\" is immediate via MP. Yes, from (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D) and A ∨ B. That's one-step: MP. So C is an immediate consequence. Option D: \" (A ∨ B) ⊃ D\" not.\n\nOption A: \"~A ∨ ~B\" not. Option B: \"~~C\" that's just ~C double negation. That's trivial from ~C? Wait we have ~C as premise, so ~~C can be derived by double negation introduction? Actually from ~C we can infer ~~C using DNE? In propositional logic, we can derive ~~C from ~C by double negation introduction? Usually the rule is: from A you can infer ~~A. So from ~C we can infer ~~C by that rule. So B is also an immediate consequence. But the problem might consider that trivial. But both C and B are immediate consequences.\n\nBut the question likely expects \"C. C ∨ D\". Because it's the direct application of MP. But B is also immediate. However maybe they consider double negation as not an inference rule? In some systems, the inference rules are Modus Ponens and other typical. Double negation introduction might be a rule, but they might not count it as a one-step immediate consequence. The typical immediate consequences from premises often use Modus Ponens, And-Intro, Or-Intro, etc. But double negation introduction might be considered too trivial? But still a rule.\n\nLet's examine the options: \n\nA. ~A ∨ ~B: Not derivable.\n\nB. ~~C: From ~C, we can get ~~C. So yes.\n\nC. C ∨ D: From MP.\n\nD.

The question says \"Which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?\" singular. So we should pick the one that is more natural.

Invalid. Counterexample when L, N, O, Q, and R are true and M and P are false D. Invalid. Counterexample when L, N, and R are true and M, O, P, and Q are false\"\n\nThey didn't give the answer. The user didn't ask anything else. So I should answer: which is correct? Probably we need to determine validity. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have premises:\n\n1. L ⊃ [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O]\n2. (N ⊃ O) ⊃ (~P ⊃ Q)\n3. R ⊃ ~Q\n\nConclusion: L ⊃ (R ⊃ P)\n\nWe need to check if valid. We'll use indirect truth table: assume premises true and conclusion false. Find assignment.\n\nLet’s analyze logically.\n\nWe need premises all true, conclusion false.\n\nConclusion false means: L ⊃ (R ⊃ P) is false. Implication false when antecedent true and consequent false. So L is true, and (R ⊃ P) is false.\n\n(R ⊃ P) false: antecedent true, consequent false. So R is true, P is false.\n\nThus we have: L = T, R = T, P = F.\n\nConclusion: L ⊃ (R ⊃ P) is false. Good.\n\nNow we must satisfy premises.\n\nPremise 3: R ⊃ ~Q. R true, so ~Q must be true => Q false. So Q=F.\n\nPremise 2: (N ⊃ O) ⊃ (~P ⊃ Q). We know P=F, Q=F. Evaluate.\n\nWe need (~P ⊃ Q) truth value. P=F => ~P = T. Then (~P ⊃ Q): antecedent true, consequent Q false => false. So (~P ⊃ Q) = F.\n\nThus premise 2 becomes (N ⊃ O) ⊃ F. For this to be true, antecedent must be false (since False -> false is true, but True->false false). Actually implication X ⊃ F is equivalent to ~X. So we need (N ⊃ O) be false. So N ⊃ O must be false. For N ⊃ O false, N must be true, O false. So N= T, O= F.\n\nSo far we have: L=T, R=T, P=F, Q=F, N=T, O=F. Need to set M, but not constrained yet.\n\nPremise 1: L ⊃ [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O]. L true, so we need [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O] true. Evaluate (M ∨ ~N). N = T => ~N = F. So M ∨ ~N = M ∨ F = M. So we need M ⊃ O to be true. O=F. So M ⊃ F is true only if M is false. If M is true, implication would be false (T ⊃ F = F). So M must be false.\n\nThus assignment: L= T, R= T, P= F, Q= F, N= T, O= F, M= F. This satisfies all premises and makes conclusion false. So argument is invalid. Which answer matches this assignment? Let's see options:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, O, Q, and R are true and N and P are false\n\nThey have L=true, M=true, O=true?? Wait O true. They set O true, but we found O false. Also N false, P false. Their assignment: L=T, M=T, O=T, Q=F, R=T, N=F, P=F. Check premises? Let's test. Premise 1: L true; M ∨ ~N = T ∨ T = T; (T ⊃ O) with O true => T ⊃ T = T. So premise1 true. Premise2: (N ⊃ O) = (F ⊃ T) = T. (~P ⊃ Q) = (T ⊃ F) = F. So (N ⊃ O) ⊃ (~P ⊃ Q) = T ⊃ F = F. So premise 2 false. So that assignment fails premise 2, cannot be counterexample. So B is wrong.\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when L, N, O, Q, and R are true and M and P are false\n\nAssignment: L=T, N=T, O=T, Q=T, R=T, M=F, P=F. Let's test. Premise 1: L true; M ∨ ~N = F ∨ F = F; (F ⊃ O) = T (since antecedent false). So premise1 true. Premise2: N ⊃ O = T ⊃ T = T. ~P ⊃ Q = T ⊃ T = T. So T ⊃ T = T. Premise2 true. Premise3: R ⊃ ~Q = T ⊃ ~T = T ⊃ F = F. So premise3 false. So assignment fails premise3, not a counterexample.\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when L, N, and R are true and M, O, P, and Q are false\n\nAssignment: L=T, N=T, R=T, M=F, O=F, P=F, Q=F. Let's test. Premise1: L true; M ∨ ~N = F ∨ F = F; F ⊃ O = T (since antecedent false). So premise1 true. Premise2: N ⊃ O = T ⊃ F = F. (~P ⊃ Q) = (T ⊃ F) = F. So premise2: F ⊃ F = T. Good. Premise3: R ⊃ ~Q = T ⊃ T = T. So premises all true. Conclusion L ⊃ (R ⊃ P). L true, R ⊃ P: R true, P false => R ⊃ P = F. So implication L ⊃ F = F. So conclusion false. Thus this assignment is a counterexample. So answer D is correct.\n\nThus the answer: D. So we should output \"D\".\n\nBut user says \"Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid.

Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent\nD. Inconsistent\"\n\nWe need to find relationship between these two formulas: (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ G and ~G ≡ (~H · G). Let's analyze.\n\nFormula1: (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ G. Equivalent to ~ (G ∨ ~H) ∨ G. ~ (G ∨ ~H) is (~G ∧ H). So formula1 = (~G ∧ H) ∨ G. This is logically equivalent to G ∨ (~G ∧ H). This is equivalent to (G ∨ ~G) ∧ (G ∨ H) by distributive? Actually use resolution: G ∨ (~G ∧ H) = (G ∨ ~G) ∧ (G ∨ H) = True ∧ (G ∨ H) = (G ∨ H). So formula1 simplifies to G ∨ H. Check: Let's test truth values: If G true, then formula1 true. If G false, then need ~H to make antecedent true? Wait compute: If G false and H false: G ∨ ~H = false ∨ true = true; antecedent true; then implication: true ⊃ G = true ⊃ false = false. So formula1 false. G ∨ H would be false ∨ false = false. Good. If G false and H true: G ∨ ~H = false ∨ false = false; implication: false ⊃ false = true (since antecedent false). G ∨ H = false ∨ true = true. Good. So indeed formula1 simplifies to G ∨ H.\n\nNow formula2: ~G ≡ (~H · G). This is biconditional: (~G) equivalence to (~H ∧ G). Equivalent to ( (~G) ∧ (~H ∧ G) ) ∨ ( (¬(~G)) ∧ ¬(~H ∧ G) ). But easier: A ≡ B is logically equivalent to (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B). Here A = ~G; B = (~H ∧ G). So formula2 = ((~G ∧ (~H ∧ G)) ∨ (G ∧ ¬(~H ∧ G))).\n\nSimplify: ~G ∧ (~H ∧ G) = (~G ∧ ~H ∧ G). That is impossible because G and ~G together. So that part false. Then second part: G ∧ ¬(~H ∧ G). Simplify: ¬(~H ∧ G) = ~ (~H) ∨ ~G = H ∨ ~G. So expression: G ∧ (H ∨ ~G) = (G ∧ H) ∨ (G ∧ ~G). G ∧ ~G = false. So we get G ∧ H.\n\nThus formula2 simplifies to G ∧ H.\n\nTherefore formula1 is G ∨ H, formula2 is G ∧ H. Are they logically equivalent? No, not equivalent. Are they contradictory? Contradictory means one true iff the other false? Actually contradictory pair means they cannot both be true at the same time, but they may both be false? Wait, contradictory means they cannot both be true, but they might both be false? In logic, \"contradictory\" means they cannot have same truth value: one true, one false? Let's recall: In logic, \"contradictory\" statements are ones that have opposite truth values in every possible world. That is, for all valuations, one true and other false. But here we can find valuations where both are true? Let's test valuations: G true, H true: formula1: G∨H = true. formula2: G∧H = true. Both true. So not contradictory.\n\nConsistent? Means there is a valuation that makes both true. Yes, G=T,H=T gives both true. So consistent.\n\nThus answer: C. (Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent).

I ⊃ ~L\n\nOptions:\nA. ~L\nB. J ≡ K\nC. I ⊃ (L ∨ M)\nD. ~L ⊃ (J ≡ K)\n\nThey ask which is not an immediate consequence. Let's analyze.\n\nImmediate consequence means can be derived by one rule of inference from the premises. Likely modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, etc. Let's see.\n\nFrom premises, we can derive: If I then J≡K. So I ⊃ (J≡K). Also (J≡K) ⊃ (L ∨ M). Also I ⊃ ~L.\n\nFrom these we can derive via hypothetical syllogism: I ⊃ (L ∨ M) because I ⊃ (J≡K) and (J≡K) ⊃ (L ∨ M). So C is an immediate consequence by hypothetical syllogism: from 1 and 2 derive 3? Wait 3 is I ⊃ ~L. So we have 1 and 2 => I ⊃ (L ∨ M). So C is a consequence.\n\nAlso from 3 we have I ⊃ ~L, so we have ~L if I. So A (~L) is not directly derivable unless we have I. But we don't have I as a premise. So ~L alone is not derivable; need I. So A is not immediate consequence.\n\nAlso J≡K is not directly derived either, because we need I. So B is not immediate. But we need to find the one that is NOT an immediate consequence. Which is the one that cannot be derived by a single inference step. Let's check each:\n\nA. ~L: cannot derive directly. No rule: from I ⊃ ~L you cannot get ~L alone. So it's not immediate. So A is candidate.\n\nB. J≡K: cannot derive directly either, need I. So B also not immediate.\n\nC. I ⊃ (L ∨ M): can be derived via hypothetical syllogism: from 1 and 2. That's one inference step: you can combine 1 and 2 to get C. So C is immediate.\n\nD. ~L ⊃ (J≡K): This could be derived by contrapositive? Wait from I ⊃ ~L we could get L ⊃ ~I by contrapositive. But not ~L ⊃ (J≡K). To get ~L ⊃ (J≡K), need to prove that if not L then J≡K. Not directly derivable.\n\nLet's examine: Using hypothetical syllogism? No. We might use the premises: 1: I ⊃ (J≡K). 3: I ⊃ ~L. We might combine to get ~L ⊃ (J≡K) if we had I as antecedent. But we don't have I. So not derivable.\n\nSo both A and D are not immediate. But we need only one. Let's double-check: Could we derive ~L from premises using some rule? We have I ⊃ ~L, but without I we cannot get ~L. So no.\n\nCould we derive ~L ⊃ (J≡K)? We could derive I ⊃ (J≡K). We also have I ⊃ ~L. We could try to get a contrapositive: If ~L then ~I, but that doesn't give J≡K. So not immediate.\n\nSo both A and D are not immediate. But the question asks \"Which of the following propositions is not an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?\" Usually only one answer is correct. Let's re-evaluate if maybe A is considered an immediate consequence. Wait: Could we get ~L by using the rule that from I ⊃ ~L we cannot get ~L alone. But we might use universal instantiation? No. So A is not.\n\nCheck D: ~L ⊃ (J≡K). We can try to derive via the rule of inference called \"Exportation\"? Not applicable. So D also not.\n\nHowever, perhaps they consider \"I ⊃ (J ≡ K)\" as premise, but they might treat it as a conditional that can be used as a premise: For any proposition, the rule \"from P ⊃ Q, infer ~P ⊃ ~Q\"? That's contrapositive. But we don't have that rule as a single step? But we might apply it: from I ⊃ (J≡K) we can infer ~ (J≡K) ⊃ ~I. But not our option.\n\nLet's examine C: we can derive I ⊃ (L ∨ M) by hypothetical syllogism. Good.\n\nThus answer should be either A or D. Let's examine B: J≡K: we have I ⊃ (J≡K). That is a conditional. Immediate consequence could be we can derive J≡K by modus ponens if we had I. But we don't have I. So B is also not immediate.\n\nThus multiple options. But perhaps they consider \"immediate consequence\" means \"derivable in one step using the standard inference rules (Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, etc.)\". Then from premise 3, we might apply Modus Ponens if we had I. But we don't. So no. So A, B, and D are not immediate. But maybe they consider that \"I ⊃ (J≡K)\" is a premise, and we can infer J≡K via the rule \"Conditional Proof\"? No.\n\nThus likely the answer is A. Wait but maybe D could be derived by hypothetical syllogism if we had ~L ⊃ I? But we don't. So D not.\n\nGiven typical exam style, the answer might be A (~L). Because it's the only one that can't be derived directly from any single premise. B also can't be derived, but maybe they think B is derivable via the rule \"Conditional proof\"? But that needs I. So no. So maybe they think B is derivable: from premise 1, we can use the rule \"From P ⊃ Q, infer Q\" if P is known to be true? But P isn't known. So no.\n\nThus ambiguous.\n\nLet's think if any of these could be derived as an immediate consequence by some rule. For C: Hypothetical syllogism uses two premises to infer a conditional: from I ⊃ (J≡K) and (J≡K) ⊃ (L∨M) infer I ⊃ (L∨M). So that's immediate. For B: maybe we can infer J≡K using the rule \"Conditional Proof\"? No. But maybe we can derive J≡K as a consequence via \"Modus Tollens\"? From I ⊃ (J≡K) and ~I we get ~ (J≡K). But no ~I. So no.\n\nThus B not immediate. For D: ~L ⊃ (J≡K). Maybe we can derive via hypothetical syllogism if we had I ⊃ ~L and I ⊃ (J≡K). But hypothetical syllogism requires antecedents to be same: I ⊃ ~L and I ⊃ (J≡K) can produce I ⊃ (~L ∧ (J≡K))? Not sure.\n\nSo D also not immediate. So there are multiple. But maybe they consider \"immediate\" as \"can be derived directly from the premises without the need for any intermediate step\" meaning one inference rule application. Then only C is immediate. So answer: A, B, D are not immediate. But they ask which one is not immediate: choose one. If they intend only one, likely A because it's the only one that seems obviously not derivable. But B also obviously not derivable. But maybe they consider that from I ⊃ (J≡K) we can apply the rule \"Conditional Proof\" to derive J≡K? But that requires I. So no. So maybe they think B is immediate because you can just \"ignore\" the antecedent and assert the consequent? That would be invalid. But maybe they think \"immediate consequence\" meaning \"a formula that follows logically from the premises\" not necessarily derivable by one rule. But then all of them follow? Actually J≡K doesn't follow because need I. So B also not immediate. So ambiguous.\n\nGiven typical logic exam, I'd answer A (~L).

Among options: A is ¬(∀x)(Lx ⊃ Rx). That's correct. B is ¬(∃x)(Lx ⊃ Rx). That would mean there does not exist a lobster such that if it's a lobster then it's red? Let's analyze B: ∃x (Lx ⊃ Rx). That is weird. If x is not a lobster, Lx false, then Lx ⊃ Rx is true. So B would mean there is some x (not necessarily a lobster) such that if x is a lobster then it's red. That is not the same. So B is wrong. C: ¬(∃x)(Lx • Rx) means there is no lobster that is red. That's too strong: \"Not all lobsters are red\" could still allow some lobsters not red but some are red. C says none are red. So wrong. D: ¬(∀x)(Lx • Rx) means not all lobsters are red? Actually Lx • Rx means lobster and red. So ∀x (Lx • Rx) would say every x is a lobster and red? Actually Lx • Rx means x is a lobster and x is red. ∀x(Lx ∧ Rx) says every x is a lobster and red, which is not the same as \"all lobsters are red\". So D is wrong. So A is correct.

Let's analyze.\n\nWe can reason. Let’s use equivalence definitions: p ≡ q is (p ⊃ q) ∧ (q ⊃ p). K ≡ ~H means K ⟺ ¬H. Also ~(K ⊃ J) means ¬(¬K ∨ J) = K ∧ ¬J.\n\nSo premises yield K ∧ ¬J. Also K ≡ ¬H gives K ⟺ ¬H. So from K, we get ¬H. So H is false. From H ≡ (I ∧ ¬J), we have H ⟺ (I ∧ ¬J). Since H is false, then (I ∧ ¬J) is false. That means not (I ∧ ¬J). So either ¬I or J (or both). So we know ¬J from K ∧ ¬J anyway. So J is false. Thus ¬J. And we have ¬I or J: since J is false, the disjunction ¬I or J simplifies to ¬I. So ¬I must be true. So we get ¬I and ¬J. So I is false and J is false. So the conclusion I ≡ J is (I ⟺ J). When both false, I ≡ J is true (since false ≡ false is true). So conclusion holds. So premises entail conclusion. So argument seems valid.\n\nThus answer A: Valid.\n\nLet's double-check no hidden issues. Premises:\n\nH ≡ (I ∧ ¬J). That means H iff (I and not J). K ≡ ¬H means K iff not H. ~(K ⊃ J). Since K ⊃ J is equivalent to ¬K ∨ J. So ~(¬K ∨ J) is K ∧ ¬J. So from premise 3, we deduce K is true and J is false.\n\nFrom premise 2: K ≡ ¬H, so K true means ¬H true. So H false.\n\nFrom premise 1: H iff (I ∧ ¬J). Since H false, we get ¬(I ∧ ¬J). That means ¬I ∨ J. But J false, so ¬I must be true. So I false. So conclusion: I ≡ J. Since both false, equivalence holds.\n\nThus conclusion is indeed logically entailed.\n\nSo answer: A.

(L ⊃ J) · K   (i.e., (L → J) AND K)\n\nWe need to check truth values for all combinations of J, K, L.

So (~(J ∨ K)) · L = T AND F = F.\n- L ⊃ J: L=F, J=F. L→J is T (since antecedent false). So (L ⊃ J) · K = T AND K.

So second is F.\n\nSo row2: first T, second F.\n\nRow 3: J=F, K=T, L=F.\n\n- J∨K = T, ~(J∨K)=F. F · L = F · F = F.\n- L⊃J: L=F => T.

So not contradictory.\n\nAre they consistent? Consistent means there exists at least one assignment where both are true simultaneously. But no row has both true: first only true in row2, second true in rows3,7,8. None overlap. So they cannot both be true at same time. So they are inconsistent (cannot be true together).

The final question: \"Select the best translation into predicate logic: No senior graduates without a major.\" Options A-D given. They haven't indicated the answer. We must answer with a single character (developer instruction). So we need to determine correct answer. Let's parse.\n\nWe have predicate Sx: x is a senior? Actually \"senior\" as in senior student? Maybe \"senior\" is a property. Gx: graduate? Actually \"graduates\" maybe a predicate indicating someone graduates? Might be \"x graduates\" as a verb. But we need translation of \"No senior graduates without a major.\" Means: There is no senior who graduates without a major. Equivalent: For all x, if x is a senior and x graduates, then x has a major. Or \"if x is a senior and x graduates, then x has a major\". But the phrase \"graduates without a major\" is \"x graduates and x doesn't have a major\". So we want to say: There does not exist a senior who graduates and does not have a major. So ∀x((Sx ∧ Gx) ⊃ Mx)? Wait we need major predicate maybe \"Mx\" or \"Gx\"? Actually Gx is probably \"x graduates\". We need a predicate for major: maybe \"Mx\" is major? But the options only use Sx, Gx. Option A: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). That says: For all x, if x is a senior then x does not graduate. That would mean seniors don't graduate at all, which is too strong.\n\nOption B: ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx). That says not (for all x, if x is a senior then x graduates). That means there exists a senior who does not graduate. That's wrong.\n\nOption C: (∀x)( ~Sx ⊃ ~Gx). That says: For all x, if not senior then not graduate. That says only seniors graduate. Wrong.\n\nOption D: (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Let's analyze: Sx ⊃ ~Gx is: if x is a senior then x does not graduate. Negating that: ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx) is logically equivalent to Sx ∧ Gx. Because A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So ~(~A ∨ B) is A ∧ ~B. Wait let's do: Sx ⊃ ~Gx means \"if senior then not graduate\". Its negation: not (if senior then not graduate). That is: Sx and Gx. So (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx) is: For all x, Sx ∧ Gx. Means every person is senior and graduates. That is wrong.\n\nSo none of the options seems correct? Let's reconsider interpretation. Maybe Gx is \"x has a major\" or something? The phrase: \"No senior graduates without a major.\" Might be: There is no senior who graduates and does not have a major. Equivalent: ∀x((Sx ∧ Gx) ⊃ Mx). But we don't see M. Unless Gx stands for \"has a major\". Actually the phrase \"graduates\" might be the predicate: \"graduates\" as a verb phrase \"x graduates\". Then we need a predicate for major? But no major means \"doesn't have a major\". That predicate not provided. Maybe Sx: x is a senior, Gx: x has a major? No that doesn't fit.\n\nLet's examine options more carefully:\n\nOption A: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). If Gx means \"graduates\", then this says \"All seniors do not graduate\", too strong.\n\nOption B: ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx). If Gx means \"has a major\"? Actually maybe Gx means \"has a major\". Then Sx ⊃ Gx means \"If someone is a senior then they have a major\". That would express \"All seniors have a major\". That's close to \"No senior graduates without a major\"? Wait that would say seniors all have majors, but does not mention graduation. But maybe the sentence \"No senior graduates without a major.\" could be interpreted as \"For any senior who graduates, they must have a major\". So it's not that seniors all have majors, just those who graduate.\n\nBut the phrase \"No senior graduates without a major.\" means \"There is no senior who graduates and doesn't have a major.\" Equivalent: For all x, if x is a senior and x graduates, then x has a major. That can be expressed as (∀x)((Sx ∧ Gx) ⊃ Mx). But Mx not available. Maybe Gx is \"has a major\". Then we need to express \"if a senior graduates, then Gx\". But we don't have the graduation predicate. The given options don't include Gx as \"has a major\", but maybe Gx stands for \"graduates\". Then we need a predicate for major, not present.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer to be option A? Let's analyze: The phrase \"No senior graduates without a major.\" The negation is \"There is no senior who graduates and does not have a major.\" Another way: \"For all x, if x is a senior and x graduates, then x has a major.\" But if we don't have a major predicate, maybe it's omitted, or we assume Gx means \"has a major\"? Then the statement could be \"No senior graduates without a major.\" meaning \"No senior graduates [unless they have a major]\"? Actually maybe they omitted the graduation predicate, and they mean \"No senior graduates without a major\" = \"All seniors who graduate have a major.\" So the correct translation would be (∀x)((Sx ∧ Gx) ⊃ Mx). But since M not available, maybe they intended Gx to mean \"has a major\" and they omitted \"graduates\" phrase. Let's examine: Option C: (∀x)( ~Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Means if not senior then not major. That's wrong.\n\nOption D: (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). That as earlier is wrong.\n\nOption A: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Means seniors do not have major. That is opposite.\n\nOption B: ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx). Means not all seniors have major. That's also wrong.\n\nSo none match. Perhaps the answer is \"none of the above\" but the question expects a single character answer. The developer instruction: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we must provide one of A, B, C, D. Which is best? Let's re-evaluate meaning of Gx.\n\nCould Gx stand for \"is a graduate\" or \"graduates\"? The phrase \"graduates without a major\" might mean \"graduates who don't have a major\". So Gx could mean \"has a major\"? Actually \"graduates without a major\" means \"graduates who lack a major\". So the property \"has a major\" is maybe Mx. But Gx might denote \"has a major\". Let's assume Gx: x has a major. Then \"No senior graduates without a major\" might be incorrectly formulated. Wait \"graduates without a major\" are those who graduate but don't have major. So the predicate for \"graduate\" is needed. But they might treat \"graduates\" as a verb phrase that means \"x is a graduate\". So Gx could denote \"x is a graduate\". Then the phrase \"No senior graduates without a major\" could be \"No senior is a graduate who lacks a major\" but lacking major property not present. Hmm.\n\nPossibly the translation expected: ¬∃x[(Sx ∧ Gx ∧ ¬Mx)]. But no M.\n\nGiven the options, maybe the intended translation is B: ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx). But that says \"It's not the case that every senior graduates\", i.e., some senior does not graduate. That is not the same. But maybe they misinterpreted \"graduates\" as \"has a major\"? Wait if Gx means \"has a major\", then Sx ⊃ Gx says \"If someone is senior, then they have a major\". The negation ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx) says \"There is a senior who does not have a major\". That's the opposite. So not correct.\n\nOption A: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Means \"All seniors do not have a major\". Also opposite.\n\nOption C: (∀x)( ~Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Means \"If not senior then not major\" which is not relevant.\n\nOption D: (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). We saw is equivalent to all seniors graduate (Sx ∧ Gx). Not relevant.\n\nThus none fits. But maybe they intended Gx to be \"does not have a major\"? Then Sx ⊃ ~Gx would say \"if senior, then not have major\" i.e., seniors don't have majors. But again wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D? Let's double-check semantics of D: (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx). Equivalent to ∀x (Sx ∧ Gx). Means all x are seniors and graduate. That's also wrong.\n\nThus the answer might be B? Wait B says not all seniors graduate. That is not same. But maybe the translation \"No senior graduates without a major\" could be reinterpreted as \"It is not the case that for every senior, if they graduate, then they have a major.\" That would be ~(∀x)((Sx ∧ Gx) ⊃ Mx). But that is weird.\n\nHowever maybe the question is flawed. But we need to give answer. The best among given might be A? Let's see if maybe Gx means \"does not have a major\". Then Sx ⊃ ~Gx means if senior then not \"does not have major\" i.e., senior then has major. That fits! Because if Gx means \"does not have a major\", then ~Gx is \"has a major\". So Sx ⊃ ~Gx means \"If senior, then has a major\". That matches \"No senior graduates without a major\"? Actually the phrase \"graduates\" might be omitted, but they want \"No senior has no major\". So the translation would be that all seniors have a major. Option A fits if we interpret Gx as \"does not have a major\". But is that consistent with context? In prior question about seniors, Gx was used? In previous question about seniors, they used Gx for \"graduates\"? No, earlier question \"No senior graduates without a major.\" They didn't define Gx earlier. So Gx could be any property. So maybe Gx means \"does not have a major\". But then Sx ⊃ ~Gx means \"All seniors have a major\" which is a plausible translation for \"No senior graduates without a major\". It implies no senior is a graduate lacking a major.\n\nThus answer: A.\n\nThus output: A.", "predicted_answer": "A", "correct_answer": "A", "is_correct": true, "ai_time_seconds": 13.68}

(B) If we do, prisons will become more crowded. (C) If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons. (D) We will have to build more prisons.\n\nThe conclusion of an argument is the last statement, usually a derived result. The premises are: 1) We shouldn't abolish capital punishment. 2) If we do, prisons will become more crowded. 3) If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons. 4) And we don't want to build more prisons. The argument seems to be that if we abolish capital punishment, then we will have to build more prisons, but we don't want that, so we shouldn't abolish capital punishment. But the first premise is \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\" So the argument might be circular. Actually maybe the first premise is not a premise but a conclusion. Let's parse: The statements are: \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment. If we do, prisons will become more crowded. If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons. And we don't want to build more prisons.\" The conclusion could be \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\" But that is given as the first statement. But maybe it's the conclusion: The argument is stating that \"If we do abolish, we will have to build more prisons, and we don't want to build more prisons, therefore we shouldn't abolish.\" So the conclusion is \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\" That is choice A. So answer is A. But maybe we consider the conclusion as \"We will have to build more prisons\"? Let's check: The argument: 1: We shouldn't abolish capital punishment. 2: If we do, prisons will become more crowded. 3: If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons. 4: And we don't want to build more prisons. The conclusion: \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\" This is consistent with the premise \"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\" That is weird, but the typical conclusion is the final sentence or the result. But the last sentence is \"And we don't want to build more prisons.\" That could be a premise or conclusion. But \"We will have to build more prisons\" is implied by 3, but it's not stated. The argument might be: (If we abolish, then prisons will be crowded) & (If prisons crowded, then we must build more prisons) & (We don't want to build more prisons) => (We shouldn't abolish).

Actually \"England's not importing beef\" is a statement, but let's use variable names: F for France subsidizes agriculture? C for China promotes human rights?

So \"England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" means \"if France subsidizes agriculture, then England not importing beef\" or the reverse? Let's think: \"A necessary condition for B\" means if B is true, then A must be true: B ⊃ A. So \"England not importing beef\" is A, \"France subsidizing agriculture\" is B. So B ⊃ A is F ⊃ ~E. Wait but the sentence says \"England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" That means: France subsidizing agriculture implies England not importing beef: F ⊃ ~E.

The premises: 1) (G ≡ H) · ~I. So premises are (G ≡ H) AND (~I). Second premise: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). That simplifies to (~G) ∨ (~H ∨ I). Equivalent to (~G) ∨ (~H) ∨ I. So premises: (G ≡ H) AND (~I) AND ( (~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)) ). Conclusion: G.\n\nWe need to test whether there's any assignment of truth values to G, H, I that makes all premises true and conclusion false.\n\nPremise 1: (G ≡ H). This is true if G and H have same truth value: both true or both false. So G=H.\n\nPremise 2: ~I must be true: I false.\n\nPremise 3: (~G ∨ ~H ∨ I). Since I false, I=F. So (~G ∨ ~H ∨ F). That simplifies to (~G ∨ ~H). Because I is false. So we need (~G ∨ ~H) to be true. That means at least one of G or H is false.\n\nNow combine with G≡H: So G=H. And (~G ∨ ~H) true means at least one of G, H is false, but since they equal, that means both are false. So G=H=F. Then (~G ∨ ~H) is true (both are false). So premises: G≡H: F≡F true. ~I: I false so ~I true. (~G ∨ ~H): true. So premises true. Conclusion G: G=F so conclusion false.

The user didn't provide an answer; they want us to choose the correct answer. We should evaluate validity of argument: Premise: ~(M ≡ ~N) ; Premise: M ; Conclusion: N\n\nWe need to check if from those premises we can deduce conclusion. Let's analyze. Equivalent: (M ≡ ~N) is M ↔ ~N, equivalently (M ∧ ~N) ∨ (~M ∧ N). The negation: ~(M ↔ ~N) is logically equivalent to XOR: (M ∧ N) ∨ (~M ∧ ~N). Wait let's compute: M ↔ ~N is true when M and ~N same truth value: both true or both false. So M↔~N true if M and ~N both true => M true and N false. Or M and ~N both false => M false and N true. So equivalently: M∧¬N ∨ ¬M∧N. Then negation ~ of that: ¬(M∧¬N ∨ ¬M∧N) is equivalent to (¬(M∧¬N) ∧ ¬(¬M∧N)) = (¬M ∨ N) ∧ (M ∨ ¬N). That's the equivalence. Let's check truth table quickly for the premises: Premise 1: ~(M ↔ ~N). Premise 2: M. Conclusion N.\n\nWe want to see if whenever premises are true, conclusion is true. Let's compute possible valuations:\n\nM can be True or False. But premise 2 says M must be true. So we only consider M= T.\n\nNow we evaluate premise1: ~(M ↔ ~N). For M = T:\n\nCompute M↔~N: For M true, ~N depends on N. If N is true, ~N is false. M↔~N: true ↔ false => false. So negation of that: ¬false = true. So if M true and N true, premise1 true. If N false: ~N true, M↔~N: true↔true => true. Negation: ¬true = false. So premise1 false.\n\nThus only valuation with both premises true is M=true, N=true. Conclusion N: N true. So conclusion holds.

We need pick correct translation. The statement: \"Some CEO is wealthier than everyone.\" Means there exists some x such that x is a CEO and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. Option A: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)]. This says: There exists x that is CEO and for all y, if y is a person AND x is wealthier than y.

That is weird because x is a CEO implies universal wealth condition. But if x is not a CEO, the antecedent is false, making the implication true.

This says: There exists x such that x is a CEO AND for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This matches. Option D: (∀x)[Px ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy)].
