Optimistic, encouraged B. Understanding, accepting C. Cynical, enthusiastic D. Sincere, resigned. We need to answer? The previous answer is blank. We need to supply answer. But instruction at beginning: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we need to output just a single character. That should correspond to the correct choice. Determine which adjectives best describe Dickens and Wordsworth.\n\nDickens wrote about French Revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" which is generally optimistic? Actually Dickens's view: He was critical of the French Revolution's brutality? He admired the Revolution but lamented excess? He is optimistic? He writes \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\". He recognizes the double nature, but maybe more cynical? He describes revolution as \"it was the worst of times\" maybe cynic? The second excerpt from Wordsworth's \"The Prelude\": It's more melancholy? Actually Wordsworth was more critical of Revolution? He was a Romantic poet; he was somewhat critical of revolution's violence. He wrote \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.\" Might be more optimistic? Let's think: The question: \"Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?\" We have two adjectives: one for Dickens, one for Wordsworth. Options pairs: A Optimistic, encouraged. B Understanding, accepting. C Cynical, enthusiastic. D Sincere, resigned.\n\nWhich pair best matches? Dickens: \"A Tale of Two Cities\" - he is critical but also acknowledges hope. He may be cynical? Actually he describes Revolution as \"the best and worst\". He might be cynical about its excess. He is somewhat optimistic about humanity? He uses \"the best of times\". So maybe optimistic? He also seems to be \"encouraged\"? Hard to parse.\n\nWordsworth: He was a Romantic poet, but his poem \"The Prelude\" is a reflection on his life, not specifically on Revolution. He was critical of the Revolution and its violence. He was more resigned? He was somewhat \"sincere\" but \"resigned\"? That might be D.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n- A: Optimistic, encouraged. Dickens optimistic? Wordsworth encouraged? Wordsworth encouraged? He was encouraging? Not sure.\n\n- B: Understanding, accepting. Dickens understanding? Wordsworth accepting? Maybe not.\n\n- C: Cynical, enthusiastic. Dickens cynical? Wordsworth enthusiastic? No.\n\n- D: Sincere, resigned. Dickens sincere? Wordsworth resigned? Wordsworth resigned to the loss? Not sure.\n\nActually the question: \"Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?\" So we need to pick adjectives that fit Dickens' view and Wordsworth's view.\n\nDickens likely critical and skeptical; he might be cynical about revolution. Wordsworth might be optimistic? Actually Wordsworth might have been more optimistic about the Revolution? Wait, Wordsworth was a Romantic, but his poem \"The Prelude\" is about his life and the French Revolution is only briefly referenced. He might be more critical. Let's recall: Wordsworth was a friend of Robert Southey, who was sympathetic to the Revolution? No. Wordsworth wrote that \"I am not an advocate of the Revolution, but I see the best in the Revolution's aim.\" So he was skeptical of violence but optimistic about ideals. That could be \"optimistic, encouraged\"? But that pair is for Dickens, Wordsworth? Option A: Dickens optimistic, Wordsworth encouraged. That doesn't match.\n\nOption B: Understanding, accepting. Dickens understanding? Wordsworth accepting? Eh.\n\nOption C: Cynical, enthusiastic. Dickens cynical? Wordsworth enthusiastic? Could be Dickens cynical, Wordsworth enthusiastic? But Wordsworth was not enthusiastic. Option D: Sincere, resigned. Dickens sincere? Wordsworth resigned? Not sure.\n\nLet's analyze Dickens: He portrays Revolution as both \"the best and the worst\". He shows the brutality but also hope. He is critical but not entirely cynical. He is skeptical about revolution's violence. So he might be \"cynical\" about revolution's violence, but also \"optimistic\" about humanity. Which adjective pair best describes Dickens? Maybe cynical.\n\nWordsworth: He wrote \"The Prelude\" with melancholic tone. He might be \"sincere\" about his feelings but \"resigned\" to the loss of innocence. So maybe Dickens cynical, Wordsworth sincere. But no such pair.\n\nLet's check each pair:\n\nA: Optimistic, encouraged. This would describe Dickens as optimistic about revolution (maybe he sees potential for good). Wordsworth encouraged? He encourages revolution? Not exactly.\n\nB: Understanding, accepting. Dickens understanding? Wordsworth accepting? Not sure.\n\nC: Cynical, enthusiastic. Dickens cynical, Wordsworth enthusiastic? Wordsworth enthusiastic? He didn't seem enthusiastic.\n\nD: Sincere, resigned. Dickens sincere? Wordsworth resigned? He resigned to loss of innocence? This maybe.\n\nHowever, we may interpret the question: \"Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?\" So we need pair describing Dickens then Wordsworth. So we need to choose the correct pair that matches Dickens' view and Wordsworth's view.\n\nLet's examine the passage: Dickens excerpt: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received...\". Dickens seems to see both good and bad. He might be \"cynical\" because he acknowledges the worst.\n\nWordsworth excerpt: \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.\" That's from The Prelude. He wrote about youth. Not about revolution. But he's reflecting on youth. He might be \"sincere\" and \"resigned\"? The phrase \"Bliss was it... to be alive\" shows a sense of acceptance? He might be resigned? He is reflecting on past and future. Maybe \"sincere\" as a description of his honest emotional perspective, \"resigned\" because he has accepted the passage of time. So pair D seems plausible: Dickens sincere? But Dickens is cynical? So maybe not.\n\nLet's think: Dickens is somewhat optimistic? Actually he wrote \"It was the best of times\" showing optimism. He also acknowledges worst. So he might be \"optimistic\" about human potential. Wordsworth? He is \"sincere\" maybe? But \"encouraged\"? Not.\n\nBut maybe the correct answer is B: Understanding, accepting. Dickens understanding of the revolution? He acknowledges complexities. Wordsworth accepting? He is accepting of revolution? But he is not.\n\nWait: The pair \"Understanding, accepting\" could be describing Dickens as understanding about revolution (both best and worst). Wordsworth as accepting? He accepts the revolution? He might be accepting of it? Actually Wordsworth might have been critical but still accepting of its ideals.\n\nLet's check historical positions: Dickens was sympathetic to revolution's ideals but critical of violence. He was \"critical but not wholly opposed.\" Wordsworth was more supportive of the revolution's ideals? He might be \"accepting.\" So B could be right: Dickens understanding (critical), Wordsworth accepting (optimistic). But pair says \"Understanding, accepting.\" That would mean Dickens understanding, Wordsworth accepting. That seems plausible.\n\nBut the question says \"Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?\" So first adjective corresponds to Dickens, second to Wordsworth. So B: Understanding (Dickens), accepting (Wordsworth). That seems plausible.\n\nHowever, I'm not fully convinced. Let's double-check:\n\nDickens's view: He is \"cynical\" about revolution? He acknowledges the worst. He may be critical. So \"cynical\" might be apt. Wordsworth's view: He is \"sincere\" or \"resigned.\" He is \"sincere\" about his feelings. But the pair that includes \"cynical\" is C: Cynical, enthusiastic. That pairs Dickens cynical, Wordsworth enthusiastic. But Wordsworth not enthusiastic.\n\nWhat about pair D: Sincere, resigned. Dickens sincere? He might be sincere about his feelings. Wordsworth resigned? He might be resigned to loss of innocence. That pair might describe Dickens as sincere, Wordsworth resigned. But the question is about their views about French Revolution, not about youth. So D may not be relevant.\n\nOption A: Optimistic, encouraged. Dickens optimistic? Wordsworth encouraged? Not.\n\nOption B: Understanding, accepting. Dickens understanding? Wordsworth accepting? That fits better.\n\nThus answer likely B. So we need to output a single character: 'B'.\n\nThus final output: B.", "predicted_answer": "B", "correct_answer": "C", "is_correct": false, "ai_time_seconds": 10.77}

The last one is incomplete: The question asks: \"Based on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following? A, B, C, D.\" The answer is missing. We need to provide the answer. The instructions: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we should respond with a single character representing the correct choice. We need to determine the correct answer. Let's analyze the poem: Du Fu's \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" around 750 CE, during Tang dynasty, describing soldiers forced to move, frontiers, nomads, etc. The poem references \"Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters: They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.\" The question: \"Based on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following?\" The options: A) Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads. B) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will. C) The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones. D) The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers.\n\nWe must determine what best describes Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples. Historically, Tang dynasty (618-907) had a policy of \"treaty and diplomacy\" with various nomadic tribes (Xiongnu, Khitan, Uighur, Tibet, etc.). They used a combination of military force, marriage alliances, and tribute. They also had military campaigns. The question might refer to the concept of the \"client-state system\" and \"marriage alliances,\" etc. The poem suggests forced conscription of soldiers and hardship. It might reflect that Tang used military force and conscripted soldiers, but also engaged in diplomacy. However, the question asks \"relied on which of the following?\" Let's recall: Tang's frontier policy included \"treaty and alliances\" with nomads, sometimes \"client-state\" arrangements. They also used \"military power\" for conquest. The poem may illustrate forced mobilization, but the question refers to \"Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples\". The best answer might be \"Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads\" (Option A). Because Tang had a relatively flexible policy of alliance and tribute, using \"marriage alliances\" and \"client relationships\". They also had the \"Xianbei\" and \"Tujue\" as client states. They also used \"military force\" but not as the sole reliance. Option B might also be plausible: The ability to project military power. But which is more accurate? Historically, Tang had both military campaigns (like against the Western Turks) and diplomatic strategies. However, the question may emphasize that Tang's relations relied on client relationships, marriage alliances, and tribute, not just military force. Let's examine each option:\n\nA. Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads. This captures the idea of using diplomatic strategies, alliances, and client states. Tang had a \"client-state\" system with the Turkic Khaganate, Uighurs, Tibet, etc. They used \"marriage alliances\" (Tang princesses married to Turkic leaders). They also used \"tribute\" and \"hostage\" as well. That seems plausible.\n\nB. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will. This also true, but might be less correct because the poem suggests the soldiers were conscripted, but the policy may rely more on diplomacy than just military force. The question likely tests knowledge that Tang used a mix of diplomacy and military. Which one is more correct? The question phrasing \"rely on which of the following?\" It might be a single answer. The poem is about soldiers being forced, but the question about the broader policy. The Tang used \"the system of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms?\" Actually no. The poem shows forced conscription, but also the difficulties of frontier life. The answer might be \"The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will.\" But that seems too simplistic. They did use military campaigns: e.g., against the Western Turks in 630s, the Tang expansion into Central Asia, etc. But their policy also involved tribute and alliances. The question may be referencing \"Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following?\" The best is \"Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads.\" Because they had the \"client-state\" system, tribute, marriage alliances. The poem may illustrate the hardships of conscripted soldiers, but the policy used diplomatic means.\n\nThus answer likely A. So we should output \"A\" as a single character.

Which is correct? Let's analyze. Robespierre's quote about terror, internal and external enemies; he says \"we must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it.\" He refers to internal and external threats. The passage states: \"This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness.

We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it.

The question: \"With which of the following threats does the speaker seem most concerned?\" He says internal and external enemies.

Historically, Robespierre feared internal counterrevolutionaries. He also feared foreign invasion. The passage: \"smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic\". Which threat is emphasised? He says \"lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror.\" The threat of enemies of the Republic. He might be concerned about both. The options: \"Counterrevolutionary opponents\" is internal. \"Foreign invaders\" is external. \"Communist agitators\" maybe not. \"Transnational corporations\" not. Which one is the most correct? The phrase \"the people's enemies\" could be internal. But maybe the question expects \"counterrevolutionary opponents\". That is likely the answer: A.

The first passage says \"While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war… most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr ... insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive.\" So it's about jihad and Muslim rulers' obligations. The second passage says Christians treated Muslim hermits kindly, didn't stop or hinder Muslims.

Option B is about use of religion to justify armed violence; that is present in the first passage, but the second passage shows peaceful interactions.

They talk about Cawnpore massacres in 1857, Indian Mutiny, violence by colonizers, British monopoly of violence, etc. The question asks: The passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence? The passage describes violence by colonial rule, oppression, and the massacre. It seems to be state-sponsored violence or genocide? Let's examine: The passage describes \"violent violence directed against it\" and \"monopoly of violence\" and that the British had \"dominant power\", \"the right to violence\" and that \"the bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities\" and that \"superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a 'humanness'\". It mentions that the revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching official alien violence by indigenous violence. The passage is about violence between colonial rulers and colonized. The question: The passages above can best be connected with which forms of violence? Let's consider each:\n\nA. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown - Not exactly; the passage is about large scale violence during the Indian Mutiny, not banditry.\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime - That could be the massacres of civilians during the war. But the passage also describes systemic violence and oppression, not just wartime killings. But maybe it's indeed civilian killings during wartime (Cawnpore massacre was killing of civilians). So B might be correct.\n\nC. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction - No.\n\nD. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide - The passage does discuss state-sponsored violence. But is it genocide? The text describes the British monopoly of violence, the violence by colonizers, but does it qualify as genocide? The term genocide usually implies systematic extermination. The passage might not explicitly mention extermination. However, the letter about Selim I earlier was about sectarian violence, but not relevant. Here, it's about the Indian Mutiny. The violence could be considered \"state-sponsored campaigns of genocide\" if it was systematic targeting of a specific group. The passage states \"the bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities\" and that Indians were treated as animals, but that might be describing colonial oppression and violence rather than genocide. The question likely expects B: \"Killing of civilians during wartime.\" Because it's specifically about the Cawnpore Massacres, which were civilian killings during the war. The question is \"The passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?\" They are about violence by colonists and violence by colonized, but it's not about banditry. It's about civilian killings during wartime. So answer B.\n\nCheck the context: The earlier passage about the Cawnpore massacre and the mention of \"the violent essential component of the British presence in India\" and \"right to violence is a privilege\" etc. The question: Which of the following forms of violence?

The last question:\n\nThis question refers to the following information. ... \"Most classical empires shared which of the following traits?\" Options: A, B, C, D. We need to choose the correct answer.\n\nLet's examine the passage. It's a passage about the decline of Rome. It mentions that \"the victorious legions\" and the \"emperors\" etc. The question asks: \"Most classical empires shared which of the following traits?\" Options:\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.\nD. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\n\nWe need to think about typical traits of classical empires (like Rome, Persia, China, etc.). The passage is about Rome decline. But we need to think of a general characteristic. Which one fits? The most common trait? Let's examine.\n\nOption A: \"They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\" Many classical empires had assimilation policies to incorporate conquered peoples, like Roman citizenship, Greek assimilation, etc. But some empires, like the Mongols, didn't require assimilation. But many classical empires did have assimilation, but not necessarily \"required\" assimilation. Also, some like the Chinese had assimilation of foreign peoples into Confucian culture, but others didn't. It's somewhat plausible.\n\nOption B: \"They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\" Classical empires like the Roman Empire had state religion and sometimes patronized other religions. But \"state support of foreign religions\" is more a concept of the Ottoman Empire (Islamic world), not classical.\n\nOption C: \"They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.\" Many classical empires did undertake public works (roads, aqueducts, canals). For example, Rome built roads and aqueducts. The Roman Empire had extensive infrastructure. The Persian Empire built roads. The Chinese built the Great Wall. So yes.\n\nOption D: \"They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\" The Roman Empire had some bureaucracy, but it was not purely merit-based; nepotism, patronage, etc. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy had a merit-based civil service exam system. The Persian Empire had a bureaucratic system, but I'm not sure if it was merit-based. So D may apply to some, but not all.\n\nThus likely answer: C. But let's think: \"Most classical empires shared which of the following traits?\" Among classical empires like Rome, China, Persia, and the Mauryan Empire, a common trait is the existence of bureaucracy based on merit? Actually, the Chinese bureaucracy was merit-based via the imperial examination system, but that developed later. The Roman bureaucracy was not merit-based; it relied on patronage and inheritance. The Persian Empire had a bureaucracy with a merit system? The Achaemenid Empire had a system of satraps selected from noble families and officials. But they weren't necessarily merit-based. So D may not be common to all.\n\nOption A: assimilation. Many classical empires integrated conquered peoples through assimilation, but some allowed them to keep their culture (like Romans allowed local customs). So assimilation may not be \"required\".\n\nOption C: public works. Yes, most classical empires engaged in public works to integrate their territories, such as roads, aqueducts, canals. That seems plausible.\n\nTherefore answer: C.\n\nThus the user asked: \"Answer:\". The correct choice: C. They want the last question's answer. They said \"Answer: \" at the end.

They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire. B. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government. C. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires. D. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\n\nWhich is most accurate? In Gibbon's passage, he mentions \"victorious legions\" and \"emperors\" but that doesn't help. The question is a general one.

Let's read the excerpts.\n\nEpic of Gilgamesh excerpt: describes house of darkness, people who enter do not come out, no light, they dwell, etc. It's describing the underworld maybe? The house of darkness. It's describing a bleak afterlife or maybe describing some punishment. The second excerpt from Maxims of Ptahhotep: \"Truth is good and its worth is lasting. It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator, whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished. It lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing. Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port… Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves. Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.\" This speaks about moral conduct and divine guidance, but not necessarily about afterlife. It mentions a \"river of life\" which could be the afterlife. It talks about obedience to gods. So what conclusion does that support? Let's examine each:\n\nA. Egyptian had less gloomy view of afterlife than Sumerian. The Sumerian text describes a bleak underworld (no light, house of darkness). The Egyptian text seems less gloomy? Actually the Egyptian excerpt does not mention gloom. It says truth is good, gods guide, wrongdoing is punished, cannot cross river of life if forbidden. It doesn't describe gloom. So maybe Egyptians had a more optimistic view. But is that supported? The Egyptian text doesn't talk about afterlife gloom. Might suggest less gloom. But does it strongly support? It might be too indirect.\n\nB. Egyptians more inclined than Sumerians to view political obedience as morally proper. The Egyptian text emphasizes obedience to gods (but not necessarily political). Sumerian text is more about afterlife. So not about political obedience. So B seems less likely.\n\nC. Egyptians more patriarchal in gender relations. There's no gender mention.\n\nD. Egyptians suffered under more rigid social hierarchy than Sumerians. The Egyptian text mentions gods guiding, forbidden passage, cannot cross river of life. That might reflect a rigid hierarchical structure. The Sumerian text is more about the afterlife. Which is more rigid? The Egyptian text may hint at a strict hierarchy: gods guiding, obedience, punishments. The Sumerian text doesn't mention hierarchy. So D might be best: Egyptians had more rigid social hierarchy. But the Sumerian text also is part of ancient Mesopotamian society, which had social hierarchies. But the Egyptian excerpt explicitly references divine rule. The question: \"best support which conclusion?\" The two texts are one from Sumerian, one from Egyptian. The Egyptian text is about moral obedience and divine guidance, indicating a hierarchical system. The Sumerian text is about underworld gloom. So conclusion D: Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than Sumerians. Does the Sumerian text mention a hierarchy? The house of darkness... People who enter cannot return. Not necessarily a hierarchy. The Egyptian text speaks of gods and path. So D seems plausible. However, the question might be from a test, maybe the answer is D. Let's see the content: The Egyptian text: \"Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves. Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.\" Suggests that those who obey gods are guided; those who are forbidden cannot cross. This implies a hierarchical system of divine guidance and punishment. The Sumerian text is more about a grim afterlife. So the conclusion that Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy is supported by the Egyptian text. So answer: D.\n\nThus we respond with \"D\".

Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\"\n\nWe need to pick one answer letter. The excerpt: Tacitus describing tribal conflicts, exiled tribes, etc. He praises the conflict among barbarian tribes. He sees it as beneficial: \"May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\n\nThus evidence of Roman desire for internal conflicts among barbarians, to keep them weak, to ease Roman control. It's about \"maintenance of large armies\" not directly. The excerpt shows Roman perspective: they are happy about conflict, maybe they think it reduces threat. So \"Concern about barbarian attacks\" may not be evidence. Actually the excerpt seems to show Roman desire to have barbarian tribes in conflict to reduce threat. So \"Absence of Stoicism among aristocracy\" no. \"Disgust for barbarian peoples\" no. \"Maintenance of large armies\" no. But likely \"Concern about barbarian attacks\" is not it. Wait, what is the question? \"The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\" The excerpt: \"It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell... May the tribes, I pray, ever retain ... at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\n\nThis seems to show Roman society's view that barbarians cause conflict among themselves, which is good for the empire. So what does this reflect? It could reflect a Roman policy of \"maintenance of large armies\" but maybe not. It could reflect \"Concern about barbarian attacks\" because they want them in conflict to reduce threats. Actually, maybe \"Concern about barbarian attacks\" is more appropriate because Romans want to keep them divided to reduce the threat to Rome. But the excerpt also says \"It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict.\" That shows they enjoyed the conflict. So it's not just concern but also delight. So maybe \"Disgust for barbarian peoples\" no. \"Absence of Stoicism among aristocracy\" no. \"Maintenance of large armies\" no. Hmm. The answer might be B, concern about barbarian attacks. But the best is B? Or maybe the best is \"Concern about barbarian attacks\" because Romans are concerned about barbarian threats but also rely on them being in conflict to reduce threat.

The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth\n\nThe passage discusses exploitation, debt, no wages, poor conditions, the owners bribing officials. So evidence for corruption among elites (lack of oversight), that king's lack of interest? Actually the passage says the king has no interest, because no remedy. But also there's corruption among elites. Which best fits? The passage emphasises that the mine owners and elites bribe officials and that the king can't intervene. So evidence for \"the king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects\" or \"the corruption among elites\". Let's see options: B says absence of corruption among elites, which is opposite. So not B. A: debt slavery: It mentions debt, but does not formal adoption of debt slavery. It describes debt but not formal slavery. D: social stratification based on origin of birth: It mentions native Indians exploited; but the passage specifically about exploitation.

Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. B. New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. C. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. D. Technological developments spread across trade routes.\n\nWe see that the passage shows that many religions coexisted in Hangzhou; Muslims, Jews, Christians, Turks, etc. Also, Chinese being called infidels by an Arab traveler; mention of Tartar ruler, etc. This indicates that trade routes were active; there was contact across Eurasia. So D seems plausible: \"Technological developments spread across trade routes.\" But the passage doesn't explicitly mention technology, just religious and demographic aspects. It shows presence of multiple religious groups and indicates contact. So maybe C: \"The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.\" But the passage mentions King of China is a Tartar, which suggests a steppe ruler. But the passage is about Hangzhou, a Chinese city, with Muslims, Jews, Christians, Turks, etc. That suggests that there were trade links across Eurasia, likely mediated by steppe nomads? Actually, the mention of Tartar rule indicates that the Chinese empire was under the control of a steppe empire. But the conclusion about trade links across Eurasia is more about \"empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.\" The passage does mention that there were Turks, Jews, Christians, Muslims present. That suggests a network of trade. But the phrase \"steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia\" is not directly stated. However, the presence of Turks and Chinese Tartar rule implies that the steppe nomad empires had influence.\n\nAlternatively, B: \"New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs.\" The passage shows that the Chinese are described as infidels, Muslims, etc. This indicates religious diversity and perhaps new religions. But it doesn't show that new religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. The passage doesn't discuss the transformation of Chinese religion, just the presence of Islam, Christianity, Jews.\n\nOption A: \"Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated.\" The passage indicates contact, so A is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Technological developments spread across trade routes.\" The passage doesn't mention technology, but it does mention trade networks; but we cannot infer technology.\n\nThus the best is C, because it directly references steppe nomads (Tartars) and trade links across Eurasia.

Direct rule by the crown\nB. Complete privatization of colonial authority\nC. Martial law enforced by sizable armies\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits\n\nWe need to pick the best answer. The first passage is by Bentinck, a Governor-General of India, part of the British Crown. The second passage is by George Simpson, Head of Northern Department of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), a chartered company. Both institutions: one is a direct crown rule, the other is chartered company. The question: \"authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?\" The answer would be D: the chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits? But Bentinck's institution was Crown direct rule. But the question might be referencing the technique that is common to both: chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits. But Bentinck's role is Crown. However, the question might be incorrectly framed: maybe the answer is A: Direct rule by the crown, because Bentinck was a governor-general, whereas the HBC was a company but the HBC had charter by the Crown, so that is a chartering of a company. However, the question: \"serving institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?\" The technique is \"chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits\" (option D). Bentinck's institution (the British Empire) had chartered companies too. But Bentinck didn't personally serve a company. But the question says authors of both passages served institutions associated with which technique. Bentinck served the Crown; Simpson served a company. The common technique among Western imperial powers includes both direct crown rule and chartered companies. But which of the options is a \"technique commonly used\"? D is a specific technique: chartering companies to assume costs and share profits. That is indeed a colonial technique. A is direct rule by the crown. Both Bentinck and Simpson served institutions associated with this technique? Bentinck definitely did; Simpson did too? No, Simpson was a company head. But the company itself was chartered by the Crown; the Crown is involved. But Simpson served a company, not Crown. So his institution is not direct rule.

We need to analyze the poem's evidence to determine which statement is correct. The poem \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" from Du Fu, ca. 750 C.E. The poem describes soldiers from Shanxi being conscripted, conscription burdens, hardships, and the suggestion that having a son leads to being conscripted, so it's better to have a daughter. So the poem indicates that sons are conscripted, daughters not. That aligns with \"Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas.\" Actually, it's the opposite: they prefer sons for conscription, so it's better to have daughters. So the poem suggests conscription quotas require sons, leading to pressure on families. So answer B: \"Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas.\" Let's verify if any other options match: A: Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong in Tang society. The poem doesn't talk about relationships between husband and wife. C: Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike. The poem indicates that women can handle a hoe and plow, so yes, suggests women can work.

The Golden Horde was tolerant of various religions, including Orthodox Christianity. It also collected tribute from Russian principalities. The Mongols in China established the Yuan dynasty, which had a centralized bureaucratic state, but the Mongol administration in China was also tolerant of religions (Buddhism, Islam, Christianity). So we need to find which difference stands out.\n\nOption A: \"was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions\" - This seems inaccurate: The Mongols in Russia tolerated Orthodox Christianity, but also other religions like Islam, Judaism. They did not restrict to only Orthodox. They were tolerant of many.\n\nOption B: \"relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state\" - That sounds correct. The Golden Horde was heavily dependent on tribute from Russian principalities. The Yuan dynasty adopted Chinese bureaucratic system. So B is plausible.\n\nOption C: \"was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\" - Not exactly: The Mongols in China had some unrest but not necessarily 'immense' as the Yuan had some revolts. The Golden Horde had some resentment but not necessarily seen as favorable.

The trade patterns being undid by something in 1750-1900.

The question: \"Which of the following developments from 1750–1900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\" The trade patterns: Portuguese trading, bringing silver, restricted by Chinese laws. The change that undid that pattern is likely the Industrial Revolution because it changed global trade patterns and made European powers (especially Britain) more powerful. But specifically, the Industrial Revolution allowed European powers to produce goods at scale and dominate trade, undermining Portuguese monopoly. So answer likely C. But let's analyze: The Portuguese were using silver from Japan and India to trade with China; Chinese restricted European trade. The development that undid that pattern would be the Industrial Revolution which allowed the British and other European powers to dominate global trade and to break Chinese restrictions. However, maybe the colonization of Africa (D) had less effect on Chinese trade. The Enlightenment revolutions (B) did not directly undid Portuguese trade patterns.

The question likely refers to the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603, which closed Japan to foreign trade, except limited trade with Dutch and Chinese. That would have impacted Portuguese trade patterns (they could only trade in limited ports). Alternatively, the Portuguese conquest of India (Mughal? Actually Portuguese conquered Goa 1510) established their own ports and changed trade patterns, but the question: \"undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph\" The first paragraph describes Portuguese bringing silver from Japan and India to China. But the Tokugawa Shogunate's policy of Sakoku (closed country) severely limited foreign trade. That would have \"undid\" those patterns. Also the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate might have restricted Portuguese trade.

Ismail proclaimed himself to be a Caliph\n\nWe must choose correct answer. Let's analyze context: The letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I in 1514. Safavids drew ire of Islamic empires such as Ottoman and Mughal primarily because they were Shia Islam, establishing Twelver Shiism as state religion, which was seen as heterodox by Sunni majorities. The Safavids were a Shia state, which was a sectarian difference. The question: \"The Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires such as the Ottoman and the Mughal Empires primarily because the Safavids...\" Option B: rejected the central tenets of Islam. That seems inaccurate: they didn't reject central tenets, they had their own interpretation. Option A: were an expansionist empire geographically located between two other expansionists. That is not the primary reason. Option C: enslaved Christians and turned them into Safavid fighters - not correct. Option D: Ismail proclaimed himself to be a Caliph. That might be a reason. Let's consider: Did Shah Ismail proclaim himself a Caliph? Historically, he proclaimed himself Shahanshah (King of Kings) and also \"Shahanshah of the Iranian People.\" He did not proclaim himself caliph. He was the founder of Safavid dynasty and Twelver Shia. He declared himself a ruler of Shia Islam, not caliph. So option D is not accurate. Option B: \"rejected the central tenets of Islam\" could refer to being Shia? Actually, Shia Islam is considered a sect but not rejecting central tenets. The primary cause of conflict was sectarian differences, especially Shia vs Sunni. Option A: \"were an expansionist empire geographically located between two other expansionists\" - maybe between Ottoman and Mughal? The Safavids were located in between. That might be a reason for being seen as threat? But historically the conflict was sectarian. But the question: \"Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires such as the Ottoman and the Mughal Empires primarily because the Safavids...\" The correct answer likely B: \"rejected the central tenets of Islam\" (though not precisely, but it's the closest). Let's think: The Safavids were a Shia state that considered their doctrines as \"innovation\" or \"evil innovation\" in the letter, so the Ottoman considered them heretic. So the cause: \"rejected the central tenets of Islam\" could be interpreted as being heterodox. That matches letter referencing \"evil innovation.\" So answer B.

It mentions question of power, neo-colonialism. Which option most directly results from foreign investment? Options:\n\nA. Establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers: That would be colonialism, but here foreign investment is not necessarily control; it can be investment but still no formal control? But could result in neo-colonial control? But the question says \"most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph\". That second paragraph: \"Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non‑aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments… The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo‑colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\n\nForeign investment may lead to increased economic dependence and possible political influence, but the passage says it should be used for national plan. The question: \"most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\" Which of the options is correct? Let's evaluate each.\n\nB: The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment. The passage doesn't discuss democratization. Not directly.\n\nC: The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism. Foreign investment might contribute to globalization. But the passage is about non-alignment and preventing neo-colonialism; foreign investment could be part of that but not necessarily lead to globalization and consumerism. But foreign investment does often lead to globalization. Which is more directly? Maybe C.\n\nD: The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies. The passage says it's a question of power and neo-colonialism; not necessarily reduce instability. So no.\n\nOption A: Formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers. Foreign investment could lead to neocolonial control? But the passage says that if foreign investors invest, they might not have formal control but can still influence. The question: \"most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph.\" Among options, the most plausible direct result: Development of globalization and spread of culture through consumerism (C).

The use of religion to enforce legal norms C. The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife D. The use of religion to explain social hierarchy.\n\nWe need to analyze the texts: Epic of Gilgamesh: it's a Sumerian epic about a king, includes moral lessons? The excerpt seems to describe a house of darkness, maybe a metaphor for afterlife? The Maxims of Ptahhotep: Egyptian wisdom text; it talks about truth, morality, instructions, social behavior. It's a kind of moral instruction, maybe for social hierarchy? But it's more about moral conduct and respect. It is a text that provides advice on how to behave in society, about being a good person, obeying law, etc.\n\nSo context: likely the texts are examples of ancient moral literature, used to instruct social norms and moral behavior, to enforce legal norms or to guide behavior. Option B: \"The use of religion to enforce legal norms\" – The texts are more like wisdom literature that may incorporate religious motifs but not necessarily legal. Option D: \"The use of religion to explain social hierarchy\" – The Maxims of Ptahhotep does discuss social hierarchy and roles. But the Epic of Gilgamesh also includes a lot about kingship and divine favor. It could be about social order. Option C: \"The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife\" – The Gilgamesh excerpt mentions \"House of Darkness,\" likely afterlife.

The question says \"the above texts are best understood in the context of which of the following?\" It might be about the use of religious or moral literature to enforce social norms. The Maxims of Ptahhotep is a wisdom text for social conduct. The Epic of Gilgamesh has religious themes, but also moral. Which best context? I'd say B: enforce legal norms. The texts instruct moral behavior that can be considered legal norms. Option D: explain social hierarchy – The Maxims of Ptahhotep mention that the wise should respect the older, etc. But Gilgamesh has kingship.\n\nOption C: conceptions of afterlife – the Gilgamesh house of darkness might be a depiction of underworld.

Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n\nWe need to choose the correct answer. Let's analyze.\n\nThe first letter is from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526. It mentions that many people are desirous of wares from the Kingdoms, they are brought by Portuguese people, and in order to satisfy appetite, they kidnap people to sell them to white men. That shows that Kongo is experiencing problems with Portuguese slave trade, and that they are complaining about the kidnappings. The tone reflects that Kongo is being exploited, but also indicates dependence on trade? It indicates that Kongo is dependent on European goods and that they are being exploited for slaves. The letter suggests the Kongo people rely on European goods and are losing people to slavery. It could reflect dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, i.e., they are buying goods from Portuguese. But the letter also indicates that the Portuguese bring goods that the Kongo want, but also the Portuguese kidnap people to sell as slaves. So it's describing the negative aspects of trade. The question: \"The tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa?\" The letter is complaining about Portuguese kidnappings and exploitation. The options:\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods — this seems plausible because the letter says the people are keenly desirous of wares, they bring goods, and they want goods. So Kongo is dependent on European manufactured goods. B. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest — the letter is not an outright resistance; it's more complaining about kidnapping. C. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline — that's a development that happened, but the letter is not directly about the posts but about the kidnapping. D. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa — the Kongo is a consolidated state. But the tone is complaining about Portuguese trade.\n\nThus likely answer A. Let's confirm: The question asks about \"tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments\". The tone is complaining about exploitation, but it also shows Kongo's desire for goods, indicating dependence on trade with Europe.

The constitutions were created by leaders like Simon Bolivar (Gran Colombia) and Dom Pedro I (Brazil). What caused them? Likely the nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism?

Let's examine.\n\nThe constitutions were produced after the wars of independence (Spanish America, Portuguese). The underlying cause: nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism? The Gran Colombia constitution unified Venezuela and New Granada under a single republic. This was driven by nationalist movement and pan-American ideas (unification).

Brazil: formed by the imperial government after independence from Portugal. The constitution was created by the monarchy, not by a nationalist movement. But the independence was from Portugal, the revolt was by Portuguese colonists. So B: Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations seems to cover both. But the Brazil constitution was by the monarchy after independence, not by provincial elites. But the question: \"most directly responsible for creating the constitutions above?\" The constitutions were created by the result of independence movements and the creation of new states. That is the result of the revolts by provincial elites? The \"revolts organized by provincial elites\" were the independence movements.

He says the union will project African personality, command respect from world that respects size and influence. Also references Great Powers disregarding Africa's independence.

D: world sees power as function of size and influence. Which best matches? He says \"a Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality.

We need to choose correct answer. Let's analyze.\n\nThe passage is about abuse in mines: Indians forced to work, no pay, forced to pay for food, concubines, etc. It led to Spanish policies to protect natives. Historically, Spanish Crown instituted \"New Laws\" (1522, 1542, etc.) to reduce encomienda abuses. The 1542 New Laws required indigenous labor to be limited, prohibited slavery, etc. They also created royal inspectors (alcaldes mayores) to oversee. Also viceroyalties were established in 1542, but that was for administration. The question: Which change to Spanish policies towards Native Americans occurred on account of practices described?

Actually, English colonists often used indentured servants, and in New England they had relatively less forced labor on natives, but in the southern colonies, they used native labor for cash crops like tobacco. But they didn't treat them like enslaved labor; they attempted to \"civilize\" them, convert to Christianity, and some intermarriage. So which option best contrasts with Spanish exploitation? Spanish had forced labor (mita), debt slavery, no pay. English had different approach: they used natives as laborers but also attempted to settle them into plantations; they often tried to \"civilize\" them. Option D says used natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops. That's not exclusive; some were enslaved but not exclusively. Option C says \"widely did not condone intermingling with the natives\" – but English actually did intermarry sometimes, especially in early colonial times. Option B: \"were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership\" – The English recognized land rights differently? They had land claims, but not exactly. Option A: \"viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas\" – that seems inaccurate; they didn't view them as equals.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is C: \"widely did not condone intermingling with the natives\"? However, historically, in the early 1600s, some English colonists did intermarry, especially in Virginia. But they were not condoned widely? But I think English colonists often tried to keep separation of races? The question likely expects that English used natives primarily for harvesting cash crops like tobacco and cotton (option D). But the word \"exclusively\" is problematic. The Spanish also used natives for mining; but the English used them for cash crops, not for mining.\n\nLet's parse: The excerpt describes Spanish exploitation in mines: forced labor, no pay, debt. The question: compared to these practices, English treatment differed in that they (option). So what is a difference? The English didn't use natives for forced labor in mines? They used them in plantations (tobacco). So D: used exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton. This contrasts with Spanish exploitation in mines. So D seems plausible. Option B: confusion about land ownership is more about legal issues, not direct difference. Option C: not condone intermingling – but the English did have some intermarriage. But maybe they did not condone it. But I think the question expects D. Let's check typical teaching: English colonists in Virginia used indentured servants and also enslaved Africans; natives were sometimes forced into labor but not as intensively as Spanish.

Alliance with Eastern bloc. Not specifically beatings.\n\nC. Imposition of Brezhnev Doctrine (1968). This was about protecting Soviet interests in Eastern Europe, to justify intervention.

The shift from overland Silk Road to maritime routes increased after Roman and Chinese decline? The Chinese counterpart likely refers to Han Empire decline around 220 CE and the rise of Three Kingdoms. The decline of Roman and Chinese both lead to fragmentation, regional states. Did that result in shift from Silk Road to sea routes? The decline of both may have impacted trade routes. But the Silk Road was still in use. The maritime routes across Indian Ocean existed earlier. Did decline of both lead to shift from overland Silk Road to sea routes? The maritime routes were already being used by Romans and Chinese for spice trade, but overland trade declined. The decline of the Roman Empire reduced overland trade in Europe, but Asian trade persisted. The decline of Chinese empire might reduce overland trade? But the Silk Road was largely overland; Chinese decline might reduce overland trade, but maritime trade might pick up. So option B may be plausible.\n\nOption A: decline in appeal of religions of salvation (like Christianity?) But Roman Empire had Christianity; Chinese had Buddhism, Daoism. The decline may not lead to decline in appeal. Christianity rose. So A unlikely.\n\nOption C: increased importance of father as head of household.

The question: \"From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore\" and options: A. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race. B. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. C. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves. D. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n\nWe need to determine which answer corresponds to the passage. The passage describes British as a superior race, the Indian as inferior, the violence as part of colonial dominance. The death of British citizens at Cawnpore is seen as part of a revolt of colonized people; the passage emphasizes that violence was essential, and the British had a monopoly; the revolt shattered it. It states \"the bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities ... that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority.\" The Indians saw them as animals. So from that perspective, the death of British citizens is seen as a result of the colonized breaking the monopoly, but not as a religious duty; the text says they \"destruction of every white man\" etc. But does it say it was a religious duty? It says \"war of religion\" but not necessarily religious duty. The death of British citizens is seen as part of a revolt to break the domination. The question asks: From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore ... The first passage is the Rudrangshu Mukherjee passage. The death is seen as part of the revolt, but is it \"seen as a religious duty\"? The passage says \"a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge... the destruction of every white man...\". So the killing might be considered as a religious duty? It says \"war of religion\" but not that it was a religious duty for the perpetrators; it's more about violence as monopoly. The death of British citizens at Cawnpore is seen as a \"betrayal\" of a higher race? The passage says the British were considered superior; the Indians considered themselves inferior; the death of British is betrayal? It might be seen as an act by the \"lesser\" race (the colonized) against the \"higher\" race, a betrayal of the social order. Option A: \"seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\" That could fit. Option B: \"should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\" The passage seems to justify violence; not just a mistake. Option C: \"can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\" The passage says the revolt shattered monopoly, but not that British themselves caused it. Option D: \"was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\" The passage mentions war of religion, but it doesn't state that killing British was a religious duty. It more likely seen as a violent revolt against the colonizers.

The question: How was the Arab trade in Africans different from Atlantic slave trade?\n\nOption A: Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion. That seems wrong: Atlantic slave trade also had religious motives? Actually Atlantic slave trade was largely economic, but also sometimes used to spread Christianity. But not primarily religious motivation.\n\nOption B: Slaves taken for Atlantic trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did. Historically, in Arab trade, some slaves could be integrated, freed, or used as concubines; but many had prospects to become free. In Atlantic, many were not free. But not absolute: some freed after servitude. But B seems plausible.\n\nOption C: Slaves taken for Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. Actually, Atlantic slave trade had more men than women (approx 70-80% male). Arab trade had more women, especially for domestic servitude. The passage indicates 300 of 400 slaves were women. So option C says opposite: Atlantic slaves predominantly female? That is incorrect. So C wrong.\n\nOption D: Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade. Not supported.\n\nThus option B is the best. But is B correct? Let's double-check: In the Atlantic trade, slaves had no prospect of eventual liberty? Many did not have freedom, but some did get freed later. But overall, the Atlantic trade had no prospect of eventual liberty for many; whereas Arab slave merchants could integrate them, some could be freed, concubines.

The excerpt says \"The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims.\" It also says that \"the king adorns himself like a woman ... The people worship idols ... The king's religion is paganism.\" So there is a Muslim elite among the court but not necessarily the general populace.

Option A says ignored or assimilated: that seems inaccurate. They did assimilate but didn't ignore? They didn't impose their religious beliefs; they were tolerant. Option B: they often took over territory without major destruction or bloodshed. Actually Mongols often did cause destruction, but they were also efficient and could be brutal. But some say they were not as destructive as others? Not sure. Option D: had little interest in trading: false, they facilitated trade across Silk Road. Option C: they imposed religious beliefs: false. Option B seems the best: they often took over territory without major destruction or bloodshed? Actually Mongols inflicted significant destruction.

So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go To Ferdinand, your king, And beg him graciously to show Full pardon for your sin.\" So Winter King (Friedrich) did something that angered Ferdinand, presumably he rebelled against Ferdinand. The lyrics say \"snatch the kaiser's crown\" perhaps he tried to seize the crown of the Kaiser? Actually \"Winter King\" refers to Frederick William I of Prussia? No, \"Winter King\" was Frederick II of Prussia? Wait, Winter King was Frederick William I? Let's recall: The Winter King (Winterkönig) was Frederick William I of Prussia? Actually Winter King was Frederick William I? Let's recall: The title \"Winter King\" was given to Frederick William I (1688–1740)? But actually Winter King was Frederick William I of Prussia? Wait, the Winter King refers to Frederick William I of Prussia, who ruled as the King of Prussia? He was a King of Prussia, but Winter King refers to the period of the early reign of the War of the Austrian Succession? Actually the Winter King was Frederick William I of Prussia, who was known as the Winter King because his reign overlapped with the War of the Austrian Succession? Or perhaps it refers to Frederick William I of Prussia who reigned 1713-1740. The Winter King was a nickname for Frederick William I, but also used for Frederick William I of Prussia? He was known for being a stern ruler, but the war? The Winter King might also refer to Frederick William I, also known as \"the Winter King\" because he was the king of Prussia during the war? He was called Winter King because of his lack of a strong army? I'm mixing.\n\nActually the Winter King was Frederick William I of Prussia, also known as \"The Winter King\" because he reigned during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). He was also known as \"the Winter King\" due to his short reign? But the song references \"Fritz\" which is a nickname for Frederick. The song says \"snatch the kaiser's crown\" maybe referring to him taking the crown from the emperor (Ferdinand? Wait, Ferdinand is the Catholic Emperor? The song says \"That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king.\" So this is the period of the War of the Austrian Succession: Maria Theresa's succession was contested by France, Prussia, and other powers. The Winter King (Frederick William I?) might have taken the crown of the Bohemian region? Actually the Winter King might be Frederick II of Prussia? Wait, the Winter King was Frederick William I of Prussia, but he was not the one who fought in the war; his son, Frederick II (Frederick the Great) fought. However, the Winter King was a nickname for Frederick William I, who had a short reign. He was called Winter King because he reigned during the \"Winter War\"?

Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nWe need to decide the correct answer. The passage describes Tacitus describing Germans killing the Bructeri etc. That is an example of barbarian peoples being conquered, maybe exterminated. The question: treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in period 600-1450 CE similar to 600 BCE-600 CE. Historically, in those earlier periods, barbarian tribes were often used as soldiers (Germanic tribes used as foederati in Roman Empire), but also were converted to religions? Also the Romans converted many barbarian peoples, e.g., converting to Christianity. But the phrase \"similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 BCE and 600 CE\" could refer to assimilation, integration as foederati, conversion, etc.\n\nThe period 600 BCE-600 CE: For example, the Romans had foederati (Germanic allies) used as soldiers, and later they were settled, etc. They also converted to Christianity (later). But the earlier period, 600 BCE-600 CE, many barbarian peoples were assimilated, used as soldiers, or settled as allies. So which option matches? Option B: utilized as soldiers. That was a common practice in Roman times. Option A: conversion to religions. The Romans did convert some, but many were pagan before Christianization. Option D: invited to rule: like the Visigoths, Ostrogoths etc. In the later period, barbarian groups were sometimes invited by the empire to rule (e.g., Theodoric). That also happened earlier: e.g., the Goths were invited to settle in Roman lands as federated peoples. But the question: \"similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.\" So we look at the earlier period's treatment: Barbarian peoples were used as soldiers (foederati) by Romans.

C: Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women. D: Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n\nWhich conclusion is supported? The passage describes that slaves resisted, so they were not passively accepted. That suggests that A is not correct. B: North Africans were captured by rival African tribes? The passage says from Algeria a caravan, they were capturing black Africans. That doesn't support B. C: Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women? Not supported. D: Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. The passage actually gives prices: Adult male Negro 10-15k cowries. But adult female Negro 10-15k. So not more. So none? Actually D says adult male slaves were most highly valued due to physical strength. The passage: \"An adult Negress 10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\" So adult male and adult female had same price. So not D. Which conclusion is supported? Maybe the correct conclusion is that Africans were not passive: they resisted. But that conclusion isn't an option. Maybe the best is A? Wait A says \"Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\" But passage shows they resisted. So A is false.\n\nWhat about B? \"North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\" Passage: They were capturing black Africans, but who captured them? They were capturing Africans from sub-Saharan Africa? They were North Africans capturing sub-Saharan Africans. So B says North Africans were captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. That is opposite. So B false.\n\nC says population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women. Not supported.\n\nD says adult male slaves valued due to physical strength. Not supported.\n\nThus none match. But maybe the answer is A because the question: \"Which conclusion is supported by the passage?\" Maybe the passage says \"They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" That suggests that slaves were not valued as merchandise? Actually they are considered merchandise but can't be prevented from escaping. The price is high. But the question: The conclusion that is supported by the passage: The passage says \"A male Negro child 45k... a female Negro child 35-40k\". That indicates that children were valued more for male. But the question about adult male vs adult female? No.\n\nLet's re-read options:\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\n\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\n\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\n\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n\nWhich is supported? The passage describes \"some rolled on ground ... refused to walk... had to be whipped.\" That indicates resistance, not passive acceptance. So A is false. B: Not supported. C: Not. D: Adult male and adult female have same price; but the passage says \"adult male Negro 10 or 15k cowries ... same for adult female.\" So not more valued. So none. But maybe the intended answer is that \"African slaves resisted and were hard to control\" which suggests that adult male slaves were not valued? But that seems not.\n\nMaybe the trick: The passage describes that adult male Negro 10-15k and adult female 10-15k, same price. But for adolescent Negro 30k, young Negress 50-60k. So female child more expensive than male child. That indicates female children valued more? But option D says adult male valued due to strength; not correct.\n\nThus likely the intended answer is A? Actually A says Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement. The passage shows they resisted, so it's contradicted, but maybe they still accepted? The passage shows they resisted but also that they were forced. That doesn't necessarily contradict acceptance? It shows resistance. So A is not correct.\n\nWhich conclusion is supported? Maybe the passage shows that North African caravans captured sub-Saharan Africans; this implies that North Africans were capturing, not being captured. So B is false. C not. D false.\n\nSo maybe none, but the quiz expects D? The passage indicates adult male and adult female equal price; but adult male not more valued. But the question might be trick: The conclusion that adult male slaves were most highly valued due to physical strength is not supported; maybe it's the one that is not supported? Wait the question: \"Which conclusion is supported by the passage?\" So we must pick the one that the passage supports.\n\nLet's check D: Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. The passage lists prices: adult male 10-15k, adult female 10-15k. So adult male not more valued; same. So D not supported.\n\nThus no correct answer. But maybe the passage indicates that women were valued more: female child 35-40k, male child 45k? Actually male child 45k higher. So male child more. So not. So perhaps the answer is that slaves were not considered merchandise because they might escape; that's basically that Africans did not passively accept, but resisted. So conclusion: They resisted. That is not an option.\n\nThus the best answer is A? But the passage contradicts it. However maybe the passage: \"They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" That indicates that they considered them not fully accepted? So maybe the conclusion is that Africans did not passively accept because they resisted. But again not option.\n\nBut maybe the test maker had a different interpretation: The passage says they are not considered as merchandise because of their chance of escape. That implies that enslavers did not fully accept them as property, so they didn't accept capture? So the conclusion that they passively accepted is false. So answer maybe D? But no.\n\nWait: Could the question be trick: The passage describes that many slaves were women (300 of 400). So conclusion about population changes: more women in slave population. That could lead to North African tribes having more women? Option C says \"Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\" That is opposite. So not.\n\nThus answer: none. But we must choose one. Possibly the intended answer: D? Wait adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. But adult male and adult female equal. But the passage states adult male and adult female both 10-15k. So not. So maybe the test incorrectly thinks adult male valued more? But that is contradictory.\n\nMaybe they consider the male child more expensive (45k) than female child (35-40k). So adult male not highest. So no.\n\nThus answer: A? The passage describes resistance, so maybe the conclusion is that Africans did not accept; but that's opposite of A.\n\nSo maybe the correct answer is A? Because the passage might say \"The price varies ... they are not considered merchandise because one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" So the slaves were not considered merchandise; so they did not accept? Actually they were captured by North Africans; but the passage shows they resisted. So maybe the conclusion is that Africans passively accepted? That is false. So no.\n\nGiven the options, maybe the only one that is supported is B? Wait B says North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. But the passage says North Africans captured black Africans; but maybe the slaves came from other African tribes; the slaves were captured by rival African tribes? Actually the narrative is from an Arab slave trader; they capture black Africans. So they are being captured by North Africans. So B not correct.\n\nThus the correct answer is none. But we must pick one. Maybe the expected answer is D? But it's wrong. Let's read again: \"Adult male Negro 10 or 15,000 cowries. They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" That line is weird. They say adult male Negro 10-15k. They then say \"They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" That might refer to adult male? Actually the \"They\" refers to adult male? Possibly. Then \"An adult Negress 10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons.\" So both adult male and adult female are same price. So adult male not more valued. So no.\n\nThus I'd answer: none, but if forced, I'd choose D? Wait D says adult male valued due to physical strength. But the passage indicates no. So I'd answer: None of the above? But we have to choose one letter. I'd choose A? But that says passively accepted. Not supported. B no. C no. D no. So none. But maybe they want to test that they did not passively accept; the conclusion is that they resisted. But not an option. So maybe they purposely gave a wrong set. But typical MCQ: only one correct. But we can't find one. But perhaps the correct answer is A, because the passage says \"they are not considered as merchandise\" which implies that they were considered as property? Wait \"they are not considered as merchandise ... because one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\" That implies that enslavers did not see them as merchandise? That indicates that they were not accepted as property? But this might indicate they did not accept capture. So A not.\n\nThus maybe the answer is D? Wait \"Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\" The passage says adult male and adult female equal. But maybe the question: Which conclusion is supported by the passage? The passage supports that adult male children were more expensive than female children? Not exactly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate: \"Adult male Negro 10 or 15,000 cowries.\" \"Adult Negress 10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons.\" So adult male and adult female same price. So no adult male more valued. So D false.\n\nC: \"Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\" The passage says 400 slaves, 300 women. So more women among slaves. That might imply that North African tribes had more women? But this is not about population changes. So no.\n\nB: \"North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\" Not supported. The passage shows they were capturing sub-Saharan Africans. So no.\n\nThus maybe the correct answer is A? Because they didn't accept; but the question is which conclusion is supported? The passage says they resisted. That means Africans did not passively accept. So the opposite of A. So not.\n\nThus answer: None. But must choose one letter. I'll answer B? Actually B says \"North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\" The passage says they were capturing sub-Saharan Africans, but who are the \"rival African tribes\"? Maybe the slaves were from rival tribes? The passage does not mention that. So no.\n\nThus I'm stuck. Maybe the test expects answer D.

They provide options. The answer isn't provided; we need to pick correct option. Let's analyze.\n\nPoem mentions \"Rhine and Prague\". It's about Winter King (Fritz?), who took the kaiser crown? Possibly refers to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, also known as the Winter King. He accepted the crown of Bohemia in 1619, leading to Thirty Years' War. After losing, he fled to Heidelberg. The poem says: \"Right well you knew, and all the world, Right well they know this thing, That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king.\" So it's encouraging him to return to Ferdinand (Habsburg). The narrator says \"So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go to Ferdinand, your king, and beg him graciously to show full pardon for your sin.\" The narrator also mentions \"Rhine and Prague\" - maybe referencing the places he must avoid. Why mention them? Because these were key territories of the Holy Roman Empire, under Habsburg control, where he could be captured? The narrator warns to stay away. So option B: \"These are lands that the Winter King lost in battle.\" But he had lost Bohemia. He also lost the Rhine region? Actually his territories were the Palatinate (Rhine region). He had to stay away from the Rhine and Prague because those were under Habsburg. Option C: \"Because these were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, the narrator warns the Winter King to stay away.\" That seems plausible.\n\nOption D: \"They are significant military posts within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire.\" But the narrator wants him to stay away. The poem says \"Now you will have to stay away Alike from Rhine and Prague\". So it's telling him to avoid those areas. Why? Because they are strongholds of the Habsburg? So C is likely correct. Let's confirm context: The poem is from 17th century. Winter King refers to Frederick V of the Palatinate. He accepted the crown of Bohemia in 1619, but lost the war quickly. He was called Winter King because he reigned only one winter. He fled to Heidelberg? Actually he fled to the Palatinate (maybe to Heidelberg). He eventually was exiled. The poem is telling him to go to Ferdinand (the Habsburg emperor) to beg pardon. He should avoid the Rhine and Prague. Why? Because those places might be controlled by enemies or be dangerous to travel? The narrator wants him to stay away from those places perhaps because he will be captured or because they are Habsburg strongholds. So Option C best explains.\n\nThus the answer: C.

Europeans engaged in opium trade because of high demand of Chinese tea and need to balance trade deficit. The reason: Chinese demand for tea; Europeans had high demand for tea in China; but China had limited imports; they had to export opium. The correct answer is C? Let's recall: The passage refers to Europeans engaging in actions described in passage: They want to bring opium into China, to trade. Background fact that persuaded Europeans: China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there? Actually the Europeans wanted to export opium because Chinese demanded tea, but Chinese didn't allow imports of goods, but the main factor: high price of tea?

The invention of the machine gun B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases C. The development of the joint-stock company D. The invention of steam-powered ships. The answer was not provided. We need to pick the correct answer. The question: Which contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa? Let's evaluate.\n\nThe period 1750 to 1900 CE. European penetration of Africa was facilitated by several technological and institutional innovations: steam-powered ships (for navigation along coasts and rivers), machine guns (for military superiority, though perhaps later in the 19th century), vaccines for tropical diseases (such as malaria, yellow fever; these improved health of colonizers, but maybe not as critical as steamships). Joint-stock companies (e.g., British East India Company, Hudson's Bay Company; but for Africa, the British and French used companies like the British East Africa Company, and also the Royal Niger Company; these played roles in colonization). So which contributed least? The development of joint-stock company is indeed important for colonization but maybe less so for African penetration relative to technology. But the machine gun also was used in 19th century colonial campaigns, but earlier? The first use of machine guns like the Gatling gun in 1860s; used in 1870s-1880s. Vaccines for tropical diseases were developed by the mid-19th century (e.g., yellow fever vaccine by Calmette & Guérin in 1880s? Actually the first effective vaccine for yellow fever was in 1892? For malaria, quinine used earlier; vaccines? Actually no effective vaccine until 1900s; but perhaps inoculation for smallpox used earlier. But the question likely expects that vaccines for tropical diseases contributed least, because there was no major vaccine for malaria or yellow fever until later, and even then not widely used. The machine gun and steamships definitely contributed. Joint-stock companies contributed too. So answer is B.

He traveled extensively across Africa, Middle East, Asia, Europe, including Arabia, Indian subcontinent, Persia, Egypt, etc. He traveled for religious pilgrimage and also for trade and learning.\n\nZheng He: Chinese mariner, 15th century, commanded treasure voyages. He traveled across Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, East Africa, etc. Similarities: both traveled across Indian Ocean, visited similar ports like Calicut, Malacca, etc. Both were part of imperial/exploration programs, but Zheng He was a Chinese eunuch serving Ming dynasty, exploring and establishing tribute relations.\n\nMarco Polo: Venetian merchant, traveled to Asia via Silk Road, visited China (Ming dynasty). He traveled eastwards, but his travels were overland and through Silk Road, not primarily Indian Ocean. Similarities: He traveled to China, but his experiences are less similar to Ibn Battuta's maritime travels.

He did not travel extensively across the Islamic world; he stayed in Europe, had diplomatic missions to Florence, Rome, etc. He is not similar at all to Ibn Battuta. So least similar: Lorenzo de Medici.\n\nBut we might consider Xuanzang: Chinese Buddhist monk, traveled to India in 7th century. He traveled along Silk Road, also traveled to Indian subcontinent. He had some similar experiences: traveling across the Indian subcontinent, learning religions. So less similar? But Ibn Battuta traveled to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
