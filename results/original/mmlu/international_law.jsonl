The question: \"What is the meaning of justiciability?\" We need to determine the correct choice among A, B, C, D. Let's think: Justiciability refers to whether a court can entertain a particular claim; it's a concept about the court's power to decide on a matter. In practice, it's about whether the matter is appropriate for judicial review, often \"capable of being resolved by courts\" - that is, whether a matter is justiciable. So which option best fits?\n\nA. \"Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\" - That's more about enforcement, not justiciability.\n\nB. \"Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right\" - No.\n\nC. \"Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice\" - Not exactly. It's not about non-enforcement.\n\nD. \"Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right\" - No.\n\nHmm none of them sound right. But maybe A? It says \"possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\" - That is not quite justiciability; it's about enforceability. The correct answer should be something like \"the ability of a court to adjudicate on a matter.\" But among these, C is closest: \"the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice.\" That's more about judicial review, but it's not about enforcement. None seem perfect.\n\nMaybe we need to pick A, because it's the only one referencing courts. Actually A says \"possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\" - That is more about \"enforceability.\" But \"justiciability\" is about whether a court can decide on the matter. So the correct answer might not be listed. But maybe the intended answer is C? Let's see: \"justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice.\" That might be the wrong definition.

Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights D. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights Answer:\"\n\nWe need to pick the false statement. Let's think: Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It amended the ECtHR's functioning. I recall that Protocol 14 (1996) introduced a new procedure for admissibility: the \"single judge\" form? Actually, Protocol 14 changed the admissibility procedure: the first hearing is conducted by a single judge, and the second hearing by a three-judge panel? Or maybe it's that the Committee that hears admissibility cases changed from a three-judge panel to a single-judge formation? Wait: The original protocol had a 3-judge panel for admissibility. Protocol 14 introduced a two-stage process: a single judge initial hearing, and then a 3-judge panel for admissibility. So statement A says: \"Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\" That's partially correct? Actually, the committee for admissibility changed from a three-judge panel to a single judge. That is true. Statement B: \"Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\" Yes, it added the \"reasonable grounds\" or \"seriousness\" criterion? I'm not entirely sure. I think it added the \"seriousness\" criterion that the case must be of serious character. So B is true. Statement C: \"Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\" That is false, because the Commission of Human Rights was replaced by the European Court of Human Rights, but the Commission was abolished earlier? Wait: The Commission of Human Rights was the body that handled applications before the ECtHR. It was abolished in 1976 (or earlier). Protocol 14 did not abolish it. So C is false. Statement D: \"Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\" I'm not sure: Did Protocol 14 change the term of office? It extended it? I think Protocol 14 extended the term of judges from 6 to 9 years? I'm not certain. But I think Protocol 14 extended the term of office of judges from 6 to 9 years?

But they didn't provide an answer. We need to respond. The user instruction: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we need to output the single character that is the correct choice. We need to choose the correct answer.\n\nWe need to know what the Kadi judgment introduced regarding the incorporation of UNSC resolutions. This refers to the Kadi v. Secretary-General (2001) case at the International Court of Justice? Actually Kadi refers to a series of judgments by the International Court of Justice on the legality of certain sanctions lists (Kadi & Al Barakaat). Or Kadi refers to a UK Supreme Court case? Wait: The question mentions \"incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions.\" That likely refers to the Kadi judgment on the incorporation of UNSC resolution 1540? Actually Kadi v Secretary-General: The Kadi case was about the legality of the sanctions against an individual listed in the UN Security Council sanctions list. The ICJ ruled that the list must be subject to review and that the sanctions had to comply with human rights. It was a landmark case regarding the incorporation of UNSC resolutions into national law. The Kadi judgments (Kadi I & Kadi II) emphasised that the incorporation of UNSC resolutions into domestic law must be compatible with human rights law, and that courts must scrutinize the application of those resolutions.\n\nBut the question: \"What dimension did the Kadi judgment introduce with respect to the incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions?\" The options:\n\nA. The Kadi judgment demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights\n\nB. The Kadi judgment demanded that all UNSC resolutions be incorporated without any further implementing legislation\n\nC. The Kadi judgment required that important UNSC resolutions be transformed and not merely incorporated\n\nD. The Kadi judgment claimed that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights\n\nWhich is correct? Likely A: It demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights. But perhaps also D? The Kadi case introduced the idea that UNSC resolutions must be compatible with human rights; if they violate human rights, they cannot be enforced. So maybe D: claimed that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights. The difference: A says they must be construed in accordance with human rights. D says they are not binding if they violate human rights. Which one is the Kadi judgment? Let's recall: In the Kadi judgment, the ICJ said that the sanctions list had to be subject to judicial review to ensure that it complied with the UN Charter and the rights to due process and non-discrimination. The Court said that the application of the sanctions must respect the rights under human rights law. The Court emphasized that the rights of the individuals subject to sanctions must be taken into account. The Kadi judgment introduced the requirement that national courts have a duty to examine the compatibility of sanctions with human rights, and if they find violations, they must invalidate them. So perhaps the correct answer is D: Kadi claimed that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights.\n\nHowever option A also sounds plausible: It demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights. That seems more like the concept that the application of UNSC resolutions must be consistent with human rights. Option D says they are not binding if they violate human rights. That is also part of the judgment. The question says: \"What dimension did the Kadi judgment introduce with respect to the incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions?\" The dimension introduced: \"human rights dimension\" i.e. that the application of UNSC resolutions must be compatible with human rights. Option A: demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights. That seems exactly the dimension. Option D: said they are not binding if they violate human rights. That is a more specific statement. The Kadi case recognized that if a resolution conflicts with human rights, the national courts could invalidate. So perhaps D is more accurate? Let's check: The Kadi judgement emphasised that the UN Security Council resolution (Resolution 1267) and its sanctions list must comply with the human rights standards. The ICJ held that the sanction list was subject to the obligation of due process and that it was subject to the right to review. The Court said that the sanctions must be compatible with human rights obligations. The decision introduced the idea that UNSC resolutions are subject to human rights obligations and may be invalidated if they violate those. So D is more correct. Option A is also close but less precise. The question might want to choose D. Let's parse each:\n\nA: demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights. That is a principle. The Kadi judgment did demand that the interpretation and application must be consistent with human rights.\n\nB: demanded that all UNSC resolutions be incorporated without any further implementing legislation. Not true.\n\nC: required that important UNSC resolutions be transformed and not merely incorporated. Not exactly.\n\nD: claimed that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights. The Kadi judgment indeed said that they are not binding if they violate human rights. The phrase \"not binding if they violate human rights\" is indeed a key outcome: if the UN resolution contravenes the human rights, then it is not enforceable.\n\nGiven the phrasing: \"What dimension did the Kadi judgment introduce with respect to the incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions?\" The dimension is the \"human rights dimension\". So either A or D. A says they must be construed in accordance with human rights. D says they are not binding if they violate human rights. The Kadi judgment introduced a \"human rights dimension\" that ensures that the application of UNSC resolutions must respect human rights. So A seems to capture that dimension. D is a specific conclusion that if they violate human rights they are not binding. But the question likely wants the answer that \"human rights dimension\" was introduced. Among options, A expresses that.\n\nThus answer likely A. But I'm not entirely certain. Let's recall actual Kadi judgment text: It said that the application of the sanctions had to comply with the Charter and the principle of due process, and that the national courts have the duty to interpret the sanctions in accordance with the Charter and human rights. The judgement said that \"the sanctions list must be subject to judicial review to ensure that it is consistent with the Charter and human rights\" (UN Charter Article 25). The judgement also held that \"the sanctions are subject to the Charter's requirement that the application of sanctions be in accordance with due process\". The judgement introduced the idea that national courts have a duty to scrutinize the application of UNSC sanctions. The dimension introduced is that the incorporation of UNSC resolutions must respect human rights.\n\nOption A: \"The Kadi judgment demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights\" fits this. Option D: \"The Kadi judgment claimed that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights\" is also a correct statement from the judgement. But which is the dimension? The dimension is human rights. Option A is a bit vague but basically the same. Option D is more specific about binding nature. The question: \"What dimension did the Kadi judgment introduce with respect to the incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions?\" They are probably expecting answer A because it's about dimension: the human rights dimension. The other options are not correct.\n\nThus output single character: A.", "predicted_answer": "A", "correct_answer": "A", "is_correct": true, "ai_time_seconds": 8.38}

However, the question doesn't specify whether the homicide is part of official duties. It's a minister committing an unlawful homicide abroad; likely it's a private act, thus jure gestionis.

Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom? Actually, Al-Adsani case: The European Court of Human Rights case of \"Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom\" (2001?).

The court concluded that diplomatic immunity does not absolve state of human rights obligations, but also that the right to a fair trial may be overridden by immunity. I need to recall.\n\nSearch memory: There is a case \"Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom\" (2001?) where the applicant was a former Egyptian diplomat, the UK dismissed him from the diplomatic service. He was tried and convicted? He was the only one? Actually, Al-Adsani was a former Egyptian diplomat who was tried in the UK for treason. He had been dismissed and was not under immunity? The issue: whether the UK could try him given his former status. The Court held that diplomatic immunity had ended with his dismissal and the UK could try him; but the right to a fair trial? The court found that he had a right to a fair trial and that the UK had violated it? Wait.\n\nMaybe the case: The Court found that the applicant had a right to a fair trial and that the UK had violated that right by not giving him the chance to be represented by a lawyer? Not sure.\n\nLet's research memory: The Al-Adsani case (2005? 2006?) The applicant was an Egyptian diplomat who had been dismissed and tried for \"treason\" and \"extortion.\" The case considered whether diplomatic immunity applies to a former diplomat. The court held that the applicant was no longer covered by diplomatic immunity and that the UK had no duty to protect him. However, the court also found that the UK had failed to give him a fair trial. So the outcome was that the applicant had a right to a fair trial but that the UK had violated it. But the question asks \"What was the outcome before the European Court of Human Rights in the Al-Adsani case?\" Options about immunity vs fair trial. The answer likely that the court held that the right to a fair trial trumped the privilege of immunity. Actually, the case: The Court held that the applicant's immunity had ended and that the UK could try him; but also found that he was denied a fair trial. So the Court considered that the right to a fair trial was not trumped by immunity because immunity did not apply. So maybe answer A.\n\nOption C says immunities were not in conflict with the right to a fair trial. That would mean that immunities don't conflict with fair trial, but that seems less likely.\n\nOption B says immunity trumped the right to a fair trial. That would be wrong because the court found the contrary.\n\nOption D says human rights considerations prevailed over all other contrary rules of international law, including most immunities.

We need to determine which articles are not qualified rights. This likely refers to the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). Qualified rights are those that can be limited. Article 3 is the right to life; it's not a qualified right? Actually Article 3 is the right to life, which is a fundamental right but can be limited under certain circumstances (e.g., self-defense, criminal law). But it is considered a \"qualified right\" or \"unqualified\"? The ICCPR Article 3 is the \"Right to life\" which is unqualified? Let's recall: Article 3: \"Everyone has the right to life.\" It is not explicitly qualified, but it is subject to restrictions? Actually the ICCPR's \"qualified rights\" are those that are subject to limitations under Article 21. Article 3 is indeed \"the right to life\" but I think it is not explicitly qualified but could be considered as a \"qualified right\"? Let's see typical lists: Qualified rights (Article 21). Article 3, 5, 7, 9? Wait, Article 9 is \"Freedom of movement\". Article 9 is indeed a qualified right. Article 5 is \"The right to be free from torture.\" Article 8? Article 8 is \"The right to liberty and security of person\"? Actually ICCPR Article 8: \"The right to liberty and security of person.\" That's a qualified right. Article 11: \"The right to be tried by a court.\" That is a qualified right. Article 3: \"The right to life\" - not sure.\n\nWait, but the question: \"Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?\" So we need to pick the ones that are unqualified. Which articles are not qualified? According to the ICCPR, Article 3 (right to life) is unqualified (not subject to limitation). Actually the ICCPR's \"qualified rights\" are those that are subject to Article 21's limitations. The right to life is considered a \"fundamental right\" but can be limited (e.g., in self-defense). But I'm not certain.\n\nLet's check: The ICCPR Article 3 states \"Everyone has the right to life.\" There is no explicit limitation. But the right to life can be restricted in certain circumstances (e.g., in self-defense, in criminal law). So is it considered a qualified right? Many treatises consider Article 3 as a \"qualified right.\" But I'm not certain.\n\nThe question may be from the ICCPR context. In the ICCPR, the following articles are qualified rights: Article 5, 7, 9, 11? Actually, the ICCPR uses Article 21 to limit rights: \"No one shall be deprived of the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Covenant except in accordance with the law and in connection with a legitimate aim.\" So which rights are \"qualified\"? According to the Covenant, Articles 5, 7, 9, 11 are considered qualified. Article 3 is considered unqualified.\n\nThus answer: A (Article 3) is not qualified. So the correct answer: A.

According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and customary international law, there's a hierarchy: treaties and custom are considered primary sources, but if there is a conflict between treaty and customary law, the treaty (or the custom) is not necessarily superseded. The general principle that treaties are primary sources, but custom is also primary. There's no absolute hierarchy. In case of conflict, the principle of \"in case of conflict between a treaty and customary law, the treaty prevails\" is sometimes applied, but that is not universal. The question might refer to \"the formal sources of international law\" which include treaties, customary law, general principles, etc. According to customary law, the hierarchy: treaties and custom are the main sources, but general principles can be used to fill gaps. The Vienna Convention Article 38(1) says: \"The law of nations consists of: i) treaties, ii) custom, iii) general principles, iv) subsidiary means.\" There is no strict hierarchy among them, but treaties are often given precedence over custom. However, the Vienna Convention says that in case of conflict between a treaty and custom, the treaty prevails. But the general principle that treaties supersede custom is not absolute.

The act of state doctrine is a principle of US law that says that courts will not sit in judgment of the acts of a sovereign state within its own territory, and will not review those acts. It's used in US law and is about sovereign immunity for foreign states. The doctrine generally precludes judicial review of a foreign state's acts in domestic courts.

I think the correct answer is C: In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory. Actually, in the Nicaragua case, the Court accepted the accumulation theory, or did it reject? Let's recall: The Nicaragua case (1986), the ICJ held that a series of acts may constitute an armed attack if they are of sufficient gravity. The Court accepted the \"continuous and cumulative\" as an armed attack? Wait, the Nicaragua case dealt with whether the US's support for the Contras constituted an armed attack. The Court held that the \"continuous and cumulative\" acts can be considered an armed attack, but the Court also rejected the idea that mere support or low-level acts are enough. The concept of \"armed attack\" can be cumulative. Actually, the ICJ accepted the \"accumulation\" theory: a series of low-intensity acts that amount to an armed attack.

The user provided a list of multiple choice Q&A. The last Q is about third state fishing rights in EEZ. The correct answer: Under UNCLOS, third states can fish in EEZ but they do not have exclusive rights, they are subject to regulations by coastal state, and they can fish for their own economic development but they must follow the coastal state's regulations. The question: \"Do third States enjoy any fishing rights within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another State?\" Let's consider options.\n\nA: When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States. This is not correct; UNCLOS does not impose that requirement. There's no such mandatory provision. So not correct.\n\nB: Third States may never have access to fisheries within another State's EEZ. This is wrong. Third states can fish subject to regulation.\n\nC: The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighbouring States. This is wrong: not only neighboring states.\n\nD: Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas. This is also not quite right: third states are not \"free\", but they have the right to fish in the EEZ subject to regulations and must not impede the coastal state's rights, and they must comply with any regulations.\n\nSo the best answer: There are no exclusive rights for third states, they can fish but subject to regulations. Among options, D seems the closest: \"Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas.\" But it's not free, but subject to regulation. However, the phrasing \"free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas\" is closer than others. But maybe the question expects \"Yes, but only for specific uses such as for the benefit of coastal state, and subject to regulations.\" But given the options, D is likely the correct one. Let's verify: UNCLOS Article 87: third states have the freedom to fish within the EEZ subject to the regulations of the coastal state. They don't have exclusive rights, but they have the right to fish for their own purposes as long as they abide by the coastal state's regulations. So they are not free, but allowed to fish.

Functional immunity, also known as immunity ratione materiae, is the immunity granted to a state official for acts performed in the exercise of their official functions. So the immunity covers the act but not necessarily the person? Actually, functional immunity covers the acts performed in the exercise of official functions.

Wait let's recall: For state officials, there are two types: immunity ratione personae (for personal immunity, covering the person), and immunity ratione materiae (functional immunity), covering acts performed in official capacity. So the correct answer is that it covers the act, not the person. Option A: \"covers the person but not the act\" - wrong. Option B: \"covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act\" - this might be wrong: functional immunity does not cover the person. Actually, the person can be prosecuted in domestic courts, but not internationally. So does it cover the person incidentally? No. Option C: \"covers the State and incidentally also the act\" - no. Option D: \"covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State\" - no. The only correct would be option B? Wait Option B says covers the act and incidentally also the person. But functional immunity is only for acts, not person. But some might say that the act is protected; the person may still be subject to domestic criminal jurisdiction. So it doesn't cover the person.

Option A: presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a state has been forewarned. That sounds like \"implied authorisation\" as a concept of the UN. But I'm not fully sure. Let's research memory: In international law, \"implied authority\" or \"implied consent\" of the Security Council can arise if the Council has, in prior resolutions, given authorization for similar actions, or if the situation has developed such that the Council's explicit approval is no longer needed. The concept of \"implied authorisation\" is not a standard doctrine. There is a concept of \"implied consent\" to a state's use of force by the UN. The doctrine often used in cases of self-defense. The principle is that if a State is subject to repeated violations, it may be implied that the UNSC has authorized use of force.\n\nOption D: \"In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation.\" That sounds like a statement of the principle, not a description of implied authorization.

The State which accepts the formation of a rule of customary law but it retains objections as to its content\n\nThe concept of persistent objector in customary international law: a State that, from the beginning of the formation of a customary rule, persistently objects to it and does not accept it. The rule does not become part of customary law for that State. So that matches option C: \"The State which persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset.\" Option A is not correct because that's after formation. Option D is not correct because it accepts. So answer: C. The developer instruction: answer with a single character.

Collective security refers to the concept where an armed attack against one member is an attack against all. It's about the right to self-defense by more than one nation acting in concert, or the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council. Let's recall definitions. Collective security is an approach where states cooperate to prevent or punish aggression. The UN Security Council can authorize collective measures. So options:\n\nA.

The authorisation of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly\n\nWhich is best? Collective security typically refers to the principle that the UN Security Council may authorize collective measures, including military force, to maintain or restore international peace and security. Option C says \"The authorisation of armed force by the UN Security Council\" - that is part of collective security. Option A describes self-defence by multiple nations acting in concert. That also aligns. Option B is similar. Option D is peacekeeping missions by GA.

Option A says \"Collective rights belong to distinct groups of people\". That is somewhat correct but not precise.

So presumably the assistant should answer the last question. The developer instruction says: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" That means we should give just a single character: presumably the correct option letter. We need to choose the correct answer for the last question.\n\nThe question: \"What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?\"\n\nWe need to know international law theory: Natural law vs positivism. Naturalism holds that law is grounded in moral principles or universal norms, while positivism holds that law is based on social facts, the decisions of political bodies, etc. Let's analyze options:\n\nA. \"On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires.\" That seems somewhat accurate: natural law has universal objective scope; positivism sees law as social construct. Might be correct.\n\nB. \"While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope.\" Not correct. Naturalism applies broadly.\n\nC. \"Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.\" That also seems somewhat correct: naturalism deals with underlying moral principles; positivism deals with rules created by states. This also captures difference.\n\nD. \"Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory.\" Not correct.\n\nSo we need pick between A or C. Which is more precise? Option A says naturalism based on universal objective rules; positivism based on structured legal system created by states in light of interests. Option C says naturalism concerns underpinning values, while positivism the rules as such. The question: \"major difference between naturalism and positivism?\" Usually: naturalism (natural law) posits that law is derived from moral principles; positivism posits law is derived from social facts. So the difference is that naturalism focuses on moral values underlying law, while positivism focuses on legal norms as rules created by authority.\n\nOption C seems to capture that. Option A also captures but slightly more wordy. Which one is best? Option C: \"Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.\" That seems to capture difference. Option A also is correct but maybe more detailed. But we need single letter. Let's evaluate which is more correct.\n\nOption A: naturalism has universal objective scope; positivism is structured legal system created by states in light of interests. That's accurate too. But is there any nuance? Natural law emphasizes morality; positivism sees law as created by humans. Option A says naturalism based on universal objective rules. That's okay. Positivism is structured legal system created by states in light of their interests and desires. Yes, that's also accurate.\n\nOption C: naturalism concerns underpinning values of international society; positivism concerns international rules as such. That is less precise but still correct. The question is \"major difference\" between naturalism and positivism. So naturalism deals with values; positivism deals with rules. That's a valid answer. Which is more commonly stated? I'd say both A and C are plausible, but A is more detailed. Which one would the answer key likely be? Possibly A. Option C seems simpler. Option A might be too wordy but still correct. But the answer key is not provided, we need to decide. The user didn't give an answer for last question, so we must choose. Let's think typical exam: \"What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?\" Standard answer: naturalism asserts that law has a basis in moral or universal principles, while positivism holds that law is based on social facts and is independent of morality. So the difference is moral vs social. Option A says naturalism is based on universal objective rules. That is moral. Positivism is based on structured system created by states in light of their interests. That fits. Option C says naturalism concerns underpinning values, positivism the rules as such. That also matches. Which is more direct? Option C: naturalism concerns underpinning values; positivism deals with rules. That is a bit vague but still correct.\n\nOption A gives more detail, specifying universal objective scope. That is correct. But also says positivism based on structured legal system created by states in light of their interests and desires. That is also correct.\n\nGiven typical exam, Option A seems the best match.

Under English law, custom can become law if it meets the criteria of \"usage\" and \"established custom\" (consistent with general principles, not contrary to law, etc). Parliament can override custom. The fundamental prerequisite? Actually, custom becomes part of law if it is established, not contrary to law, and is accepted as such.

Options: Golder v UK (1978), A v UK (2009), Goodwin v UK (2002), Osman v UK (1998). Need to choose correct one. The \"living instrument\" principle refers to interpretation of Convention as living instrument. Which case best illustrates? I recall A v UK (2009) case involving the right to privacy and the principle? Let's think.\n\nGolder v UK 1978: It's about discrimination in education (gender). It involved the Court adopting a more progressive approach? Not sure.\n\nGoodwin v UK 2002: about a child abuse? Not sure.\n\nOsman v UK 1998: about \"Right to respect for private life and family\" in context of \"protection of privacy\" and \"reasonable expectation\". That case had \"living instrument\" principle? Actually, Osman v UK is a case that deals with the right to privacy and the principle of \"living instrument\" - but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nA v UK (2009) might be the case where a 16-year-old was given a \"custody\" order? Actually \"A v UK\" (2009) might refer to the case \"A\" where the ECtHR considered the principle of \"living instrument\" in a case regarding \"S\" but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's recall: The \"living instrument\" principle is a key interpretive method used by ECtHR. Many cases illustrate this: \"O. v. the UK\" or \"A v UK (2009)\" maybe \"A\" refers to \"A\" being \"A\" maybe \"A\" is a child? Let's search memory: In 2009, the Court had a case \"A v. UK\" (No 2) about \"the right to life and privacy\" but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"Goodwin v UK (2002)\" is about a father who had a child that had been adopted? I'm not sure.\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\n1) Golder v UK (1978): The case concerned a woman who was denied a post in a university because of gender discrimination. The Court held that there is no violation of Article 14 or Article 2. The case may illustrate the \"living instrument\" principle? Actually, Golder was decided early; the Court didn't adopt living instrument principle widely until later. So not likely.\n\n2) A v UK (2009): The case is \"A\" refers to \"A\" maybe \"A\" is \"A\" (like \"A\" is a \"child\"?). The case might be \"A v UK (2009)\" regarding \"the right to respect for private life\" and \"the living instrument\" principle? I need to recall. I think \"A\" refers to \"A\" (the 2009 case about the right to be free from \"home treatment\" and \"treatment in prison\"? Not sure.\n\n3) Goodwin v UK (2002): This case was about a man who was convicted of \"possession of child pornography\" but the Court found no violation of Article 14? Actually, I think Goodwin was about \"disability discrimination\"? Wait, maybe Goodwin v UK (2002) refers to \"Goodwin v. UK\" about the right to privacy and \"living instrument\" principle? But Goodwin is not widely cited as living instrument case.\n\n4) Osman v UK (1998): This case concerned a man who had been arrested for \"breach of the peace\" and the Court found that the state had violated Article 8 (right to private life). The Court also discussed the living instrument principle? I recall that the Court said that the Convention is a \"living instrument\" that must be interpreted in light of current circumstances, but maybe that principle was already used earlier.\n\nLet's research memory: The \"living instrument\" principle is often illustrated by the case \"O. v. the United Kingdom\" (1998). Actually, that case was about \"the right to respect for private and family life\" and the Court used the principle to interpret the Convention. It recognized that the Convention should be seen as a living instrument that adapts over time. So likely Osman v UK is the case that best illustrates the living instrument principle.\n\nBut the question: \"Which of the following cases best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights?\" So the answer is likely \"Osman v UK (1998)\" because it's the most well-known case illustrating that principle. But let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, \"A v UK (2009)\" might be \"A\" meaning \"A\" but we might not know. Let's check memory: In 2009, the Court had \"A v UK (2009)\" regarding a \"child\" who had a \"broad\" case about \"right to liberty\"? Actually, I think the case was \"A\" where \"A\" is \"A\" maybe \"A\" stands for \"A\" (the 2009 case \"A\" \"A\"?). There is \"A\" case about \"A\" - the \"A\" case where the Court considered the living instrument principle regarding \"the right to respect for private life\" in the context of \"the state's obligation to take measures to prevent domestic violence\"? I'm not sure.\n\nLet's search memory: The ECtHR case \"A v UK (2009)\" is about \"A\" \"the right to liberty\" and \"the right to a fair trial\". Wait, maybe it's the \"A\" case regarding \"the right to a fair trial\" for a \"prisoner\" who had \"a 'mental disorder'.\" But this doesn't ring.\n\nHowever, \"Osman v UK\" is definitely a 1998 case that deals with the \"living instrument\" principle. The Court used it to interpret Article 8. So likely the correct answer is Osman v UK (1998).\n\nThus answer: D.", "predicted_answer": "D", "correct_answer": "C", "is_correct": false, "ai_time_seconds": 6.4}
