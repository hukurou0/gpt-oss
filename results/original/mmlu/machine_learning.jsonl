RoBERTa used a larger corpus: the same data + CC-News 140M, OpenWebText 8M? Actually RoBERTa used 160GB of text from BookCorpus, CC-News, OpenWebText, Stories, and CC-100? Wait. Let's recall: RoBERTa used 160GB of text from 8 sources, which is about 3.3B tokens? Actually BERT used 3.3B tokens; RoBERTa used 160GB of text, which is about 10x BERT? Let's check. I think RoBERTa's pretraining corpus was 160GB of text (approximately 10x larger than BERT). Many sources say RoBERTa uses 160GB, which is about 3.3B tokens?

Actually BERT's tokens are ~3.3B tokens. 160GB might be ~3.3B tokens? Let's quickly compute: 1 GB = 1e9 bytes ~ 1B characters. 160GB = 160B characters. 160B / 6 chars per word ~ 26B tokens.

Then each variable is binary: each CPT has 1 independent parameter. H has 1 independent parameter, P has 1 independent (given parent W: 1 independent param). Actually for binary variable with parent W (binary) we need 2-1 =1 independent param for each parent assignment. So P: for each value of W, we need 1 independent param, so 1*? Wait formula: for variable X with k possible values and parents with m possible value combinations, the number of independent parameters is (k-1)*m. For binary X (k=2), k-1=1.

Let's recall known results: For half-planes in R^d, VC dimension is d+1. For general (not necessarily axis-aligned) rectangles (convex quadrilaterals with right angles) maybe VC dimension is 5?

I'm not certain.\n\nGiven typical ML knowledge, I'd lean that data-dependent weight init came later than BatchNorm? Actually, I think the typical answer: Statement 2 is False: Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced after BatchNorm. Wait the wording: \"Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\" If we think of \"Batch Normalization\" introduced 2015, data-dependent init like \"Kaiming\" came 2015 too? But \"BatchNorm\" came first? Actually Kaiming He did \"Delving Deep into Rectifiers\" 2015, same year as BatchNorm.

So Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: Logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes with identity covariances: There is a relation but not a one-to-one correspondence between parameters. Logistic regression is discriminative; GNB is generative; with identity covariance, the generative model yields a linear decision boundary same as logistic regression, but parameters differ (e.g., logistic regression coefficients equal to difference in means times inverse covariance). There is a relationship but not a one-to-one mapping? I think there is a mapping: parameters of logistic regression equal to difference of class means times inverse covariance plus offset. For identity covariance, it's linear. There is a one-to-one relationship between weight vector w and mean difference. But is it one-to-one? For each logistic regression weight vector, there is a GNB with corresponding means? If we fix priors equal, maybe? But generally, logistic regression parameters can be any real vector; GNB parameters are means and covariance, but with identity covariance it's just means. For any logistic regression, can you find means that produce that w? Yes, w = Sigma^-1 (mu1 - mu0). If Sigma is identity, w = mu1 - mu0. So w gives difference of means. But you need to set priors: logistic regression includes bias term; that bias is related to prior log odds plus difference of mean dot w? Actually logistic regression logit = w^T x + b. For GNB, log odds = (mu1 - mu0)^T x - 0.5*(mu1^T mu1 - mu0^T mu0) + log(pi1/pi0). So b = -0.5*(mu1^T mu1 - mu0^T mu0) + log(pi1/pi0). So given w and b, you can solve for mu1 and mu0? There's more degrees of freedom: you can choose mu0 arbitrarily and then set mu1 = mu0 + w, then compute b accordingly. So there's infinite solutions for GNB given logistic regression, not one-to-one. Conversely, given GNB, you get w uniquely as mu1 - mu0, and b determined. So mapping from GNB to logistic regression is one-to-one, but from logistic regression to GNB is many-to-one.

The instruction says: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" The last question is this AdaBoost question; answer choices are letters A-D. So we need to decide the correct choice.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n1. In AdaBoost, weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor. In AdaBoost, after each iteration, weights are updated: D_{t+1}(i) = D_t(i) * exp(alpha_t * I(h_t(x_i) != y_i)) / Z_t. The multiplicative factor for misclassified examples is exp(alpha_t). For correctly classified, factor is exp(-alpha_t). So misclassified get the same multiplicative factor (exp(alpha_t)). So statement 1 is true.\n\n2. In AdaBoost, weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t. Weighted training error of each weak learner is computed with current weights D_t. As t increases, the distribution is updated to focus on misclassified examples; subsequent weak learners might have higher error? Actually AdaBoost tends to select weak classifiers that perform slightly better than random; but as weights shift to previously misclassified ones, the weighted error may actually increase because more weight is on harder examples. In theory, the weighted training error of each weak learner may not necessarily increase; but I recall that AdaBoost tries to minimize weighted error. In AdaBoost, each weak learner is chosen to have weighted error e_t <= 0.5 (for binary classification). The weighted error may vary; but due to the weighting scheme, it's possible that e_t increases or decreases; I think it tends to increase because the weight is more on hard examples. However I'm not sure if it's a trend. The statement \"tends to increase as a function of t\" is likely false. I think the weighted training error tends to stay around 0.5 or maybe decrease? Let's check.\n\nIn AdaBoost, after each iteration, weights are updated so that misclassified examples get higher weight. So next iteration's weak learner is forced to focus on them. That learner may perform better on those but will likely have higher weighted error because it focuses on hard examples? But since it is also a weak learner, it can only get error <= 0.5. The weighted error may fluctuate; but it might not necessarily increase; it's not guaranteed to increase. Many textbooks say that the weighted error of each subsequent weak learner is <= 0.5; but there is no monotonic increase.\n\nThus statement 2 is likely false.

They haven't answered this yet. The user hasn't asked a question explicitly. The instructions from the developer say: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we must answer that last question with a single character. The answer to that multiple choice: \"The model obtained by applying linear regression on the identified subset of features may differ from the model obtained at the end of the process of identifying the subset during\". Options: A. Best-subset selection B. Forward stepwise selection C. Forward stage wise selection D. All of the above\n\nWe need to recall: In best subset selection, we pick subset and fit model on that subset; in stepwise, the final model might be different because at each step the coefficients may have been updated with previously added variables? Actually, best subset: you choose the subset, then fit full model on that subset. In stepwise, each step you add a variable and refit? The final model after selection might differ from applying linear regression on that subset due to differences in regularization? Hmm. Wait: The question: \"The model obtained by applying linear regression on the identified subset of features may differ from the model obtained at the end of the process of identifying the subset during ...\"\n\nWe need to think: In forward stepwise selection, after selection, the final model is the one built at the last step, which might be the same as fitting linear regression on the selected subset? In best subset, we might use criteria like AIC, BIC? But final model may differ because of selection bias? The standard answer: \"All of the above\". Because when you do forward stepwise, the model at each step is built by re-fitting on the selected variables, so the final model is indeed the same as fitting linear regression on that subset. For best subset selection, you fit the model on the selected subset as well. But maybe the difference arises due to different algorithms: In best subset, you might use a subset selected by e.g. cross-validation, but the final model might be different if you then refit? Wait.\n\nLet's recall: In forward selection, you add variable at each step and re-fit. The final model is the linear regression on the selected subset. So there is no difference.\n\nIn best subset selection, you identify subset by some criteria but then you can re-fit linear regression on that subset to get coefficients; that is the same as the model at the end? However, there might be difference if you used the same algorithm to fit? But best subset selection uses the same linear regression on each subset, but the subset chosen is the best by some metric; the final model is the same.\n\nBut the question might be about the fact that the model obtained by applying linear regression on the identified subset of features may differ from the model obtained at the end of the process of identifying the subset during forward stepwise selection due to the fact that the forward algorithm uses a different selection criterion that might have been influenced by the fit at each step. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's think: Suppose we do forward stepwise selection to choose variables, but at the end we might have the best model on training set but might have different coefficients if we refit on the entire training set? Actually, forward stepwise algorithm re-fits at each step, so the final coefficients are the ones from that final step. If we then refit on the same subset, the coefficients will be the same because linear regression is deterministic. So no difference.\n\nBut perhaps the difference arises because of the use of regularization like ridge? But not in typical stepwise.\n\nThe question likely expects answer D: All of the above. Because the model may differ in all three selection methods: best-subset, forward stepwise, forward stagewise. Maybe the answer is that the final model may differ because of the fact that forward stepwise selection may produce a suboptimal subset, and thus the final model may differ from the one obtained by fitting linear regression on that subset? But that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the question refers to the fact that if you do best subset selection, you might use some penalty on the number of predictors, which results in a biased estimate of coefficients; but if you then refit on the selected subset without penalty, you get different coefficients. In stepwise selection, each step may incorporate penalization or use of a criterion like AIC which includes penalty on number of predictors. So the final model may differ from refitting on the selected subset. In forward stagewise selection, you incrementally add small amounts of variable, leading to different coefficients than refitting.\n\nThus, the answer: D.

In RBF kernel, mapping into infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. 1-NN in that space: distance equals sqrt(K(x,x)+K(y,y)-2K(x,y)). For RBF kernel, K(x,x)=1. So distance between x and y = sqrt(2-2K(x,y)). So 1-NN in kernel space corresponds to maximizing kernel similarity (K(x,y)). That can improve classification because points of same class may become closer. But it's not guaranteed.

So Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM.\n\nWe know perceptron is a linear classifier that uses weight vector w and threshold 0 (or bias). Linear SVM also uses linear decision boundaries but with margin maximization. VC dimension for linear separators in d dimensions is d+1 (if includes bias). The perceptron also is linear separator, so VC dimension is the same: d+1. So VC dimension of perceptron is equal to VC dimension of linear SVM.

Statement 2| The depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree. Options: A. True, True B. False, False C. True, False D. False, True. We need to determine correct answer. Let's analyze statements:\n\nStatement 1: \"The kernel density estimator is equivalent to performing kernel regression with the value Yi = 1/n at each point Xi in the original data set.\" Kernel density estimation (KDE) is estimated as \\hat{f}(x)=1/(n h) \\sum K((x-x_i)/h). Kernel regression (Nadaraya-Watson) is \\hat{m}(x)= \\frac{\\sum K((x-x_i)/h) y_i}{\\sum K((x-x_i)/h)}. If we set y_i=1/n? Let's check: If y_i=1/n, then numerator: \\sum K((x-x_i)/h) * (1/n). Denominator: sum K((x-x_i)/h). So \\hat{m}(x)= \\frac{(1/n)\\sum K(...)}{\\sum K(...)} = 1/n. That would be constant, not KDE. So statement 1 is false. Alternatively, if you set y_i = 1, then numerator = \\sum K(...), denominator = \\sum K(...), gives 1. Not correct. Actually, kernel density estimation is like regression with y_i=1 for all i? Wait, there is a connection: The KDE can be seen as regression of a binary variable? But the statement as given is likely false.\n\nStatement 2: \"The depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree.\" Depth refers to number of edges from root to leaf. In worst case, each node splits on different attribute, but depth cannot exceed n-1? Actually, in decision tree, each leaf can represent a subset of training instances. Depth can't exceed number of training examples? Let's think: In binary tree, the maximum depth can be n-1 if tree is a chain of splits each separating a single example? But you cannot split on attribute to create nodes if attribute values are distinct? Suppose you have n training examples each with a distinct value for a unique attribute. You could build a tree of depth n-1? But depth could be > n? Is it possible? In a decision tree, each split reduces number of examples. If we have a leaf node that splits one example, you might have depth n. But depth cannot exceed n-1 maybe. But statement says \"larger than the number of training examples.\" That seems impossible because each split requires at least one example in parent. The maximum depth of a binary tree with n leaves is n-1, but depth can be at most n-1, which is less than n. So statement 2 is false.\n\nThus answer: False, False => option B. But check if depth can be larger: Actually, with multiway splits, depth can be less than number of examples. But can depth > n? Suppose you have n examples, each node can have splits that result in leaves that contain at least one example. In worst case, you split until each leaf contains only one example. That yields tree depth of at most n-1. So cannot exceed n-1. So false. So answer B.\n\nThus last question answer is B.

We need to evaluate.\n\nQuestion: Statement 1| Since the VC dimension for an SVM with a Radial Base Kernel is infinite, such an SVM must be worse than an SVM with polynomial kernel which has a finite VC dimension. Statement 2| A two layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, trained on a given dataset; the boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators, therefore these two algorithms will give the same result.\n\nOptions:\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nWe must analyze each statement.\n\nStatement 1: VC dimension infinite for SVM with RBF kernel (Radial Basis Kernel). It's true that RBF kernel can represent arbitrarily complex decision boundaries; VC dimension is infinite (infinite). Then the claim: such an SVM must be worse than an SVM with polynomial kernel which has a finite VC dimension. This is incorrect. Higher VC dimension does not guarantee worse performance; it can overfit but not necessarily. Also it's not a must. So statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: Two layer neural network with linear activation functions: that means essentially a linear model? Let's think: a two layer neural network (one hidden layer plus output). If hidden layer uses linear activation functions, then the whole network is linear: because the composition of linear functions is linear. So it's essentially a linear model. Boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators: e.g., AdaBoost with linear weak learners. If the boosting algorithm uses linear separators as weak learners, the boosted classifier is a weighted sum of linear separators, which could be non-linear (since sum of linear functions is linear? Wait: sum of linear classifiers is linear? Let's examine: If each weak learner is a linear separator (i.e., a linear classifier that outputs +1 or -1?), the sum of such is a linear combination of sign functions. This is not necessarily equivalent to a linear classifier; could be more complex. But the statement says the two algorithms will give the same result. That is likely false. Two-layer linear NN is linear function; boosting of linear separators can produce non-linear classifier (like decision tree style). So statement 2 false. But we must double-check.\n\nLet's analyze: Suppose we have a two-layer neural network: Input -> hidden nodes -> output node. Hidden nodes have linear activation functions: f(x)=Wx + b. Then output node might be linear activation? Typically a single neuron. So overall function is linear: output = w2^T (W1 x + b1) + b2 = (w2^T W1)x + (w2^T b1 + b2) which is linear. So network is linear.\n\nNow boosting algorithm built on linear separators: Usually each weak learner is a linear classifier (like perceptron). AdaBoost's output is sign( sum alpha_t h_t(x) ). Each h_t(x) outputs ±1. The sum of them weighted gives some score; sign of sum gives classification. That is not a linear function, because the weak learners' outputs are discrete ±1, not continuous. So boosting may produce non-linear classifier. So the two algorithms will not give the same result in general. So statement 2 false.\n\nThus both statements false. Option B: False, False.\n\nThus answer: B.\n\nWe need output single character 'B'.\n\nCheck for any trick: Statement 1: Could we argue that RBF VC infinite but still not necessarily worse?

The functional form of f’s decision boundary is the same as h’s, but with different parameters. Eg if h was a linear classifier, then f is also linear. In boosting, the combined classifier is usually a weighted sum of weak learners. If weak learners are linear, f is a weighted sum of linear functions, which is linear? The weighted sum of linear functions is linear only if the same linear function is used with different weights? Actually each weak learner might be a linear classifier defined by a weight vector w_i. The combined classifier f(x) = sign( sum_i α_i h_i(x) ). Each h_i(x) = sign(w_i·x). That is not linear due to sign of each weak learner.

We need to evaluate statements.\n\nStatement 1: \"Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions.\" Let's recall: Highway networks introduced by Srivastava et al. 2015 \"Training Very Deep Networks\" (maybe 2015). ResNet introduced by He et al. 2015, \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\". Highway networks predate ResNets? Actually Highway networks came out in 2015 (in NIPS 2015) same year as ResNets. Some sources say Highway networks were introduced before ResNets (like 2015). ResNet was 2015. Highway networks were 2015 too. But maybe Highway networks were introduced before ResNets? Let’s check: Highway networks paper \"Highway networks\" (2015). ResNet paper also 2015. The Highway network paper was first accepted at NIPS 2015? ResNet accepted at CVPR 2015. So highway networks came earlier? I think ResNet first appeared 2015 in CVPR, but published earlier? Highway networks were at NIPS 2015, but not sure the exact dates. Let's consider the content: Highway networks do use gating to allow training of very deep networks, but they do not necessarily eschew max pooling. In Highway networks, typical architectures may include convolution and pooling layers. They are not specifically eschewing max pooling. So statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: \"DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.\" DenseNet architecture reuses feature maps, which may increase memory usage but they also have fewer parameters because of dense connectivity. But memory usage: DenseNet tends to use more memory for intermediate feature maps because each layer receives all previous feature maps. This can be memory intensive, but also the number of parameters may be less. But memory consumption can be higher due to concatenation of feature maps. Many sources mention that DenseNet is memory-intensive but less parameter-wise. So statement 2 is probably true. So overall: Statement1 false, Statement2 true => \"False, True\" option D.

The instruction from developer says: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So I must provide the answer as a single character, presumably the letter of the correct option.\n\nWe need to decide which options are spatial clustering algorithms. Partitioning-based clustering like K-means is partitioning-based; grid-based clustering is also spatial. Partitioning-based clustering refers to algorithms like K-means, PAM, etc. Are they spatial? K-means uses Euclidean distance, so it's spatial. Grid-based uses spatial partitioning. Partitioning-based clustering itself is a type of clustering, but maybe \"partitioning based clustering\" is a broad category; it's not specifically spatial? Actually, partitioning based clustering can be applied to any data, but when data are spatial (like coordinates) it can be considered spatial. The question: \"Which of the following are the spatial clustering algorithms?\" The correct answer: K-means and Grid based clustering are spatial. Partitioning based clustering is a category; not specifically spatial. So D \"All of the above\" would include Partitioning based clustering, which might not be specifically spatial. The likely answer is B and C, but the options are single choice. The question seems ambiguous. Usually, spatial clustering refers to algorithms that cluster data based on spatial features. Partitioning based clustering is a general approach, not necessarily spatial. But K-means uses distances, so it's spatial. Grid-based clustering uses spatial grids. So answer might be B and C, but since only one letter allowed, maybe D if the question expects that all are considered spatial. But I'd lean that Partitioning-based clustering is not specifically spatial, it's general. So answer likely \"B\". However, the developer instruction says answer with a single character. So we respond with \"B\".\n\nBut let's re-evaluate: Partitioning based clustering includes K-means, but if the question is \"Which of the following are the spatial clustering algorithms?\" It might refer to algorithms that cluster based on spatial data: partitioning-based, grid-based, density-based etc. Partitioning based is a type of clustering that can be used for spatial data. The question might be from a textbook that lists spatial clustering algorithms as: partitioning based, grid-based, density based. So all of the above might be correct. But we don't have density based as an option. The options include Partitioning based clustering, K-means clustering, Grid based clustering. All of these are spatial clustering algorithms.

In theory, margin maximization correlates with generalization bound (VC dimension). But does it guarantee lowest error? It's not guaranteed to be lowest empirical error; generalization bound is upper bound but doesn't guarantee minimal error. It's often believed that larger margin helps generalization, but not guaranteed to be lowest possible. So likely false.\n\nStatement2: \"Any decision boundary that we get from a generative model with classconditional Gaussian distributions could in principle be reproduced with an SVM and a polynomial kernel of degree less than or equal to three.\" Classconditional Gaussian => discriminant function is quadratic (since log ratio of Gaussians gives quadratic form).

But in terms of modeling, logistic regression is not linear regression. Linear regression predicts continuous numeric outcome; logistic regression predicts probability of class. So logistic regression is not a special case of linear regression.

In SVM, larger margin is usually correlated with better generalization, but margins alone might not be enough to guarantee better test performance? Usually a larger margin leads to better generalization bound. But the statement says that margin values do NOT tell us which classifier will perform better. That seems false: larger margin is associated with better generalization. However, this might be nuanced: margin is defined in feature space, but margin on training set may not correlate strongly with test performance. But generally the margin bound suggests larger margin leads to lower generalization error. But the statement is \"do not tell us which classifier will perform better\" meaning that margin alone is not enough? I'd lean that it's true: margins alone don't guarantee test performance because the bound depends also on norm of weights, dimension, etc. But it's a bit ambiguous. However, standard teaching: a larger margin on training set yields a better generalization bound. So margin does inform about test performance.

So P(A ∧ ¬B) = 0.25 * P(¬B) = 0.25 * 2/3 = 0.25 * 0.6667 = 0.166667. Exactly 1/6? 0.1667. Yes that's 1/6.\n\nThus P(A ∧ ¬B) = 1/6.\n\nWe also know P(A) = P(A ∧ B) + P(A ∧ ¬B).

Naive Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence of attributes given class, which is a strong assumption; it's not necessarily optimal even if we know the joint distribution.

If we assume full covariance matrices, we have many parameters; if we assume diagonal, fewer. Full covariance can overfit if small data. Similarly, allowing each class to have different means vs sharing same mean vector: if we share means, we reduce parameters, might underfit. So which is the biggest? I'd say B: Whether we assume full class covariance matrices or diagonal class covariance matrices, as that changes the number of covariance parameters drastically. Option A: Learning centers by ML vs gradient descent: that's about optimization algorithm, not structural. Option C: Priors equal vs estimated: that changes prior estimation, but not huge complexity.

Typically, with regularization, training error always increases with λ. Because you add penalty, making model less flexible, so training error will increase (or at least not decrease). Actually, training error will increase or stay same. So answer: A: will never decrease the training error. Option B: will never increase training error? That would mean training error decreases as λ increases, which is false. Option C: will never decrease testing error? Actually, testing error might decrease as λ increases initially, but not guaranteed monotonic. Option D incomplete.

When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive. Yes, if you predict a box but no ground truth, it's false positive. True.\n\nD. A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to 3% would likely be considered at false negative. Wait: false negative refers to missing a detection of an object. If a bounding box with IoU=3% is a predicted box that partially overlaps but too small, it's likely considered false positive? Actually IoU=3% is very low, but if there is a ground truth, a predicted box with low IoU might be considered a false positive because it's not matching any GT. However false negative refers to a missing detection. But a low IoU box is not matched to any GT, so it's counted as false positive. So statement says \"would likely be considered at false negative\" - that's false. So answer: D.\n\nThus output should be \"D\".

{"subject": "machine_learning", "question_number": 110, "analysis": "We have a set of multiple choice questions with answers indicated for some. The last one: Which of the following is false? Options A-D with statements.\n\nWe need to identify the false statement.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement.\n\nA: \"The following fully connected network without activation functions is linear: $g_3(g_2(g_1(x)))$, where $g_i(x) = W_i x$ and $W_i$ are matrices.\" This is linear composition: each g_i is linear map W_i x. Composition of linear maps is linear. So statement A is true.\n\nB: \"Leaky ReLU $\\max\\{0.01x,x\\}$ is convex.\" Let's examine convexity of function f(x)=max(0.01x, x). Since x is linear, 0.01x is linear with slope 0.01; x has slope 1. The max of two linear functions is convex. Actually the maximum of convex functions is convex. Each linear function is convex (and concave). So the max is convex. So B is true.\n\nC: \"A combination of ReLUs such as $ReLU(x) - ReLU(x-1)$ is convex.\" Let's check: ReLU(x) = max(0,x). ReLU(x-1) = max(0, x-1). So difference f(x) = max(0,x) - max(0, x-1). This is piecewise linear. Let's compute: For x <=0: ReLU(x)=0; ReLU(x-1)=0 (since x-1 <= -1 <0). So f=0. For 0< x <=1: ReLU(x)=x; ReLU(x-1)=0. So f = x. For x>1: ReLU(x)=x; ReLU(x-1)=x-1. So f = x-(x-1)=1. So f(x)= 0 for x<=0; =x for 0<x<=1; =1 for x>1. This is not convex: Let's check convexity: A convex function defined piecewise linear should have non-decreasing slopes. Slope is 0 for x<0? Actually slope for x<0 is 0. For (0,1) slope=1. For x>1 slope=0. So slope increases from 0 to 1 then decreases to 0 -> not convex. So C is false.\n\nCheck D: \"The loss $\\log \\sigma(x)= -\\log(1+e^{-x})$ is concave.\" Wait $\\log \\sigma(x) = \\log(\\sigma(x))$? Actually logistic loss: cross-entropy negative log-likelihood? Usually $\\ell(x) = - \\log \\sigma(x) = -\\log(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}) = \\log(1+e^{-x})$. But given expression $\\log \\sigma(x)= -\\log(1+e^{-x})$ that's just log-sigmoid function, which is concave? Let's analyze. f(x) = log(sigmoid(x)) = - log(1+exp(-x)). Compute second derivative: derivative: f'(x) = - [ - exp(-x) / (1+exp(-x)) ] = exp(-x)/(1+exp(-x)). Actually differentiate: g(x)=1+exp(-x). ln g(x)=ln(1+e^{-x}). derivative: g' / g = (-e^{-x})/(1+e^{-x}). But negative sign outside: f'= - g'/g = -(-e^{-x}/(1+e^{-x})) = e^{-x}/(1+e^{-x}). So f' = 1/(e^{x}+1) = sigmoid(-x). That's decreasing? Actually derivative positive and decreasing? Let's compute f'' = derivative of sigmoid(-x). f'' = - sigmoid(-x)(1-sigmoid(-x)). That's negative, meaning f is concave. Wait f'' negative, so concave. So D is true (concave). So false statement is C. So answer should be C.\n\nBut the prompt: \"Please answer the last question with a single character.\" So we should output the single character that corresponds to the wrong statement: options A-D.

{"subject": "machine_learning", "question_number": 112, "analysis": "We need to answer last question multiple choice: Statement 1 about derivative of sigmoid equals variance of Bernoulli random variable with success probability sigma(x).

So Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: Setting bias parameters to zero changes bias-variance tradeoff such that variance increases and bias decreases. Setting biases to zero? In a neural net, biases allow shifting activation functions. If we set biases to zero, we reduce flexibility; the model becomes less expressive: might increase bias (underfitting). Variance may decrease because model complexity reduced. So statement says variance increases and bias decreases. That seems opposite. So Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus answer: True, False => option C.\n\nSo we answer single character?
