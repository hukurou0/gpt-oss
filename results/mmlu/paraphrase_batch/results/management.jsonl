Choices A-D. We must select the right answer. Peter Drucker's five management principles are: 1) \"The organization's main purpose is to create customers.\" 2) \"The organization should have a set structure.\" 3) \"The organization relies on performance measurement.\" 4) \"The organization utilizes its human capital.\" 5) \"The organization is considered a public institution.\" Recalling: Drucker\u2019s rules include \"The purpose of an organization is to create a customer.\" \"The organization as a public institution.\" \"The organization is a learning organization.\" \"The organization has a formal structure.\" \"The organization is a system of performance metrics.\" Hold on, not completely certain. Let's recall: Drucker: 1) The aim of business is to create and keep a customer. 2) The organization has a structure. 3) The organization employs performance metrics. 4) The organization is a learning entity. 5) The organization uses a system of performance measurement. Hmm.\n\nGiven these options: A) Making people\u2019s strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant. B) Enhancing people\u2019s ability to contribute. C) To operate the organisation\u2019s status system. D) Integrating people in a common venture by defining, setting, and embodying organisational objectives, values, and goals.\n\nWhich one is NOT? Let's consider: Drucker's principles are centered on organizational structure and customers, less on individual strengths. Option A about strengths: Seems like McClelland? Actually, that's more personal growth. Option B: improving people's contributions - that's more people management but Drucker highlights people as assets. Option C: running the organization's status system - unclear. Option D: joining people by defining and setting goals - that's related to management by objectives? That is a Drucker idea: \"Management by objectives\" is associated with him. Option A and B might be out. Which is not one of his five main principles? Drucker's five management principles are: 1. Organization\u2019s aim is to make customers. 2. The organization is a public body. 3. The organization has a formal structure. 4. The organization employs performance metrics. 5. It is a learning organization. None of these options are an exact match. But maybe this refers to another list: Drucker\u2019s 5 principles: 1) Focus on strengths. 2) Seek opportunity. 3) Use others\u2019 strengths. 4) Consider people. 5) etc. Not entirely sure.\n\nChecking memory: Drucker\u2019s 5 key principles in management: 1) The main aim is to create a customer. 2) The organization acts as a public institution. 3) The organization has a clear structure. 4) The organization utilizes performance metrics. 5) The organization becomes a learning organization. None of the options seem to fit exactly, except maybe C (operating the status system) is not included. Option C \"To operate the organisation's status system.\" That is not one of Drucker's principles.

The last question is:\n\n\"Which of these factors is not one of the competing responsibilities that influence corporate social responsibility?\nA. Ethical\nB. Economic\nC. Discretionary\nD. Technical\nAnswer:\" We're supposed to pick the right choice. The question asks: \"Which of these factors is not one of the competing responsibilities that influence corporate social responsibility?\" Usual categories in CSR are: Economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic. \"Discretionary\" is uncommon; \"technical\" is also unusual. Standard models involve \"economic, legal, ethical, philanthropic.\" Looking at the choices: Ethical, Economic, Discretionary, Technical. Here, both Discretionary and Technical aren't common. But which isn't a \"competing responsibility\"? Maybe \"Discretionary.\" \"Technical\" normally isn't considered a responsibility. Technical could mean meeting technical standards? Usually it\u2019s not. Is \u201cDiscretionary\u201d an error? \"Discretionary responsibilities\" can mean voluntary actions in CSR. However, the intended answer may be \"technical\" as it isn't one of the listed responsibilities. Looking deeper: \"Competing responsibilities\" refers to company goals\u2014profit, compliance, ethics, charity, etc. In CSR, \u201ceconomic, legal, ethical, philanthropic responsibilities\u201d dominate. Technical isn\u2019t mentioned. Carroll\u2019s framework includes economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic. \"Discretionary\" and \"philanthropic\" are sometimes used interchangeably for voluntary actions, but \"technical\" doesn't fit. The question: Which of these is NOT one of the competing responsibilities behind corporate social responsibility? The answer should be \"Discretionary\" or \"Technical.\" But recalling: Frameworks explicitly list Economic, Legal, Ethical, and Philanthropic. \"Discretionary\" may relate to philanthropic. Thus, \"discretionary\" might be voluntary (philanthropic). The question likely looks for \"technical\" as not being among the categories. However, \"discretionary\" could also be counted out. Still, \"discretionary responsibilities\" are actually the voluntary/philanthropic category. Thus, the answer should be \"Technical,\" as it\u2019s not in the main framework. \"Discretionary\" refers to voluntary, but \u201ctechnical\" is not listed as a major responsibility. The question: Which of these is NOT a competing responsibility that influences corporate social responsibility? From the choices, only \"Technical\" is definitively outside the Carroll model.

Let's determine which thinker stated \"There is no discernible link between planning and performance.\" Considering history, Milton Friedman (B) was notable for saying \"the business is the public\" and was often skeptical of planning. However, he also famously argued \"The business has no other purpose than to increase its profits\"\u2014not about planning. Gary Hamel (C) is a significant management figure, author of \"The Future of Management.\" Henry Mintzberg (D) wrote on strategic management and criticized rigid planning as a concept.\n\nReflecting, perhaps Milton Friedman wrote the phrase, but it could also be from Gary Hamel\u2014well-known for his critiques of planning approaches, possibly writing \"There is no discernible link between planning and performance.\"\n\nRecalling other sources, Mintzberg was critical of top-down strategy but may not have used that phrase. Hamel is associated with statements like \"The End of Planning.\" Upon review, the user gave four choices: A. Michael Porter, B. Milton Friedman, C. Gary Hamel, D. Henry Mintzberg.

Gary Hamel.\n\nGiven the requirement, the response should be just \"C\".\n\nOn reconsideration: Drawing from memory, \"There is no discernible link between planning and performance\" is connected to Gary Hamel, likely from \"The Future of Management\" or \"Leading the Revolution.\" Hamel asserted the value in the process rather than the outcome. Still, perhaps it's Milton Friedman. Friedman criticized planning, too, but mostly in the context of free markets and did not quite use that expression.\n\nLet\u2019s examine each option:\n\nMichael Porter: famous for industry analysis, not focused on planning versus performance.\n\nMilton Friedman: advocated the free market, often skeptical of planning's value.\n\nGary Hamel: critical of bureaucracy and traditional planning, likely to have said this.\n\nHenry Mintzberg: critiqued strategic planning in \"The Fall of Strategic Planning\" and \"Strategy Safari,\" but the quoted phrase isn\u2019t strongly attributed to him.\n\nLooking at all these, the quote most aligns with Gary Hamel\u2019s views as expressed in management literature, such as \"The Future of Management,\" where he dismisses a direct link between planning and business results.
